Rubik's Cubes\n        blindfolded. It may look long, but that's just because there are so many\n        images. There are no prerequisites — you don't need to know how to solve\n        a Rubik's Cube, or anything about them really. If you've seen one\n        before, that will be enough background (and in case you somehow haven't,\n        there's an image at the top of this article, so you have no excuses). In\n        particular, you don't need to know how to solve one 'normally' (that is,\n        without a blindfold). In fact, the techniques and methods for regular\n        solving (also known as 'speed solving' if one uses a timer) are\n        completely different from those for blindfolded solving, so you won't be\n        at any disadvantage.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        How does blindfolded solving work? You're given a scrambled cube. You\n        get to look at it as long as you'd like, without making any turns/moves\n        — the memorization phase. Then you don a blindfolded and make moves to\n        (attempt to) solve it without being able to see what you're doing — the\n        execution phase. Of course, you may be successful or unsuccessful in any\n        given attempt. You can time yourself — and many do — but we'll ignore\n        that aspect.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The execution phase often seems completely out of reach to people. In\n        these articles, we will focus on the memorization phase, and only\n        briefly mention the execution phase when necessary, without getting into\n        many details. It may seem odd to only examine half of the process, but\n        it turns out that how one memorizes a scrambled cube and how one\n        executes the solution are mostly independent of each other. No matter\n        whether a 'basic'/'beginner' execution method is used or an 'advanced'\n        execution method is used, the memorization method is more-or-less the\n        same.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The memorization phase, which we've just agreed to focus on, can itself\n        be broken down into two components. First we need to figure out what to\n        memorize, and then we need to actually memorize it. Anything involving\n        memorization is often perceived as daunting by most people, just like\n        the execution phase. In these articles, we will only focus on figuring\n        out what we need to memorize, and instead of memorizing that\n        information, we will just write it down.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To summarize (the introduction): We will be ignoring what are often\n        perceived as the two most difficult parts of solving a Rubik's Cube\n        blindfolded, and instead examine the much more accessible aspect of\n        figuring out what we would need to memorize. Moreover, we won't even\n        start with a cube — we'll start with some playing cards, which are much\n        more familiar and hopefully much less scary.\n      </p>\n      <h2>A simpler case study: Six playing cards</h2>\n      <p>\n        Suppose we have the ace through six of spades laid out in a row in front\n        of us. I strongly recommend going and getting some cards (or any 6\n        numbered objects, really) and following along with everything we go\n        through below.\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}\n        caption=\"Ace through six of spades, laid out in a row.\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        In this simple 'game' that I'm making up, the cards are placed in a row\n        in any order, and the goal is to get them ordered by rank, ace through\n        six. We'll say a card is correctly placed if it's in the spot it needs\n        to be in, and is incorrectly placed otherwise. To start, let's forget\n        about being blindfolded at all. We can see the cards, and we can pick\n        them up and move them around however we please. How would you get them\n        in order?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        No really, stop and think about it. Can you think of a good way to do\n        it? Or maybe several possible ways to do it? There are no wrong answers\n        at this point.\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]}\n        caption=\"A random arrangement of the cards.\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        One way to do it is to pick up all the cards and put them in our hand\n        (as if we were playing a card game). Then either place them back in\n        their correct positions one at a time in the order that we picked them\n        up, or sort them in our hand and then lay them out in order. Maybe you\n        came up with a similarly but slightly different method just now, or one\n        which is completely different.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To reiterate, there are no wrong answers. However, some answers will be\n        more helpful than others in working towards our ultimate goal regarding\n        a Rubik's Cube. A solution involving picking up all the cards works well\n        here, but if we had 52 cards, or hundreds of cards, it wouldn't work\n        very well. So with that in mind, we're now going to add a restriction to\n        this card sorting game: We can't pick up all the cards at once anymore —\n        we can only pick up two cards at a time, and swap their positions. Now\n        what would you do? (Or maybe your initial answer above still works!)\n      </p>\n      <p>Don't just keep reading. Think.</p>\n      <p>\n        An intuitive way to proceed is to scan for pairs of cards which need\n        swapping and swap those. If there are no such pairs, then just do any\n        swap that will get one of the two cards into place. This is a good idea\n        (and actually quite efficient), but can we make it more systematic? If\n        we had hundreds of cards, it would be hard to scan for pairs which need\n        swapping.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Given enough time, many people seem to converge on the following idea:\n        Find the ace and swap it into the correct position (that is, swap the\n        spot that the ace is currently in with the spot that the ace belongs\n        in). If the ace is already correctly placed, then there's nothing to do.\n        Next, find the two and swap it into position. And so on, with the three,\n        the four, and finally the five. (Once we've got the first five cards in\n        place, the sixth is automatically in place. In fact once we get any five\n        cards correctly placed, we get the last one for free.)\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]}\n        caption=\"The random arrangement from above.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4]}\n        caption=\"Finding the ace and swapping it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4]}\n        caption=\"The two is already correctly placed, so we find the three and swap it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5]}\n        caption=\"Finding the four and swapping it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}\n        caption=\"Finding the five and swapping it into the correct position. The six comes for free.\"\n      />\n      <p>If you came up with a different idea, that's great!</p>\n      <p>\n        This isn't actually necessary for our purposes, but let's pause and ask:\n        How many swaps will this take? One for getting the ace into position —\n        or none if it's already correctly placed. Same for the two through five.\n        So that's at most five swaps — less if any of those cards were already\n        correctly placed. It turns out that this method will always use the\n        minimum (optimal) number of swaps — it's impossible to do better.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This method, of swapping each card into place one at a time, is, as we\n        just saw, extremely good. But for our ultimate goal of applying these\n        techniques to a Rubik's Cube, there is a closely related method which\n        will work better. In this method, instead of first finding the ace and\n        swapping into the correct position, we will look in the ace's spot (the\n        left-most spot) and swap that card to where it belongs. In other words,\n        instead of first solving the ace, we first solve the card in the ace's\n        spot. Instead of moving onto the two's spot and solving the card there,\n        we can just keep going with the ace's spot until everything is solved.\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]}\n        caption=\"The same random arrangement as above.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[6, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4]}\n        caption=\"Seeing the three in the ace's spot and swapping it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 6]}\n        caption=\"Seeing the six in the ace's spot and swapping it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]}\n        caption=\"Seeing the four in the ace's spot and swapping it into the correct position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}\n        caption=\"Seeing the five in the ace's spot and swapping it into the correct position. The ace comes for free.\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        If you try out a few examples on your own, you might run into some\n        ambiguity. What if we swap the first card out of the ace's spot, and\n        then the second card out of the ace's spot, but then the third card in\n        the ace's position is the ace itself? Well if the rest of the cards\n        happen to be correctly positioned already then that's great, we're done.\n        But what if they aren't?\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq inds={[5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4]} caption=\"A new random arrangement.\" />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4]}\n        caption=\"Swapping the five into position.\"\n      />\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]}\n        caption=\"Swapping the two into position, which results in the ace being correctly placed before we're done.\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        A natural inclination here is to just move on to the next spot which\n        contains an incorrectly placed card (say the four's spot in the image\n        above) and do the same things: repeatedly swap the card in the four's\n        spot into the spot it belongs, until we eventually get the four.

This seems a bit unproductive, since\n        this swap hasn't put any cards in the correct place. (In fact, the ace\n        is leaving it's spot, so we have less correctly placed cards now!).\n        However, the ace's spot now contains an incorrectly placed card, and we\n        can continue with the original strategy of dealing with whatever card is\n        in the ace's spot.

However, this is a trade-off that we're willing to make because\n        of two main benefits, which we'll see shortly.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The only thing left to discuss in this case study is the memorization.\n        Recall that we aren't going to talk about memorization techniques here,\n        or how to memorize anything — we'll just write things down. But the\n        question then is what do we write down? And can we figure it all out\n        without physically performing any swaps?\n      </p>\n      <CardSeq\n        inds={[5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4]}\n        caption=\"The same random arrangement as above.\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Likely your first thought is to write down the sequence of swaps that\n        will be made. Consider the above example (which we already solved\n        earlier). First, we swap the ace's spot and the five's spot. After that,\n        the five will be correctly placed, and the two will be in the ace's spot\n        — and we know this without actually physically swapping any cards (but\n        if you're having trouble seeing it, do the actual swaps). The next swap\n        will be the ace's spot with the two's spot. Then the two will be\n        correctly placed, as will the ace. Since the ace is correctly placed but\n        we're not done, we need to select any card which is incorrectly placed\n        and swap it with that. So let's say we swap the ace's spot with the\n        four's spot. Now we know the six will be in the ace's position, so we\n        next want to swap it with the six's spot. Then the six is placed\n        correctly and the four is now in the ace's spot. So we want to swap the\n        ace's spot with the four's spot. What's in the four's spot though? It's\n        the ace, since we put it there with the swap right after the ace was\n        correctly placed. So now everything is correctly placed (the three was\n        correct the whole time). (Was that hard to follow? Keep reading, it gets\n        much easier!)\n      </p>\n      <p>To summarize, we swapped the following spots:</p>\n      <div>(A, 5), (A, 2), (A, 4), (A, 6), (A, 4)</div>\n      <p>\n        Notice that every swap involves the ace's spot (by design). So in fact,\n        we really only need to write down the other spots:\n      </p>\n      <div>5, 2, 4, 6, 4</div>\n      <p>\n        The reasoning we walk through above is all about swaps and thinking\n        about where cards will be. But — and this is where things get easier —\n        we don't actually need to keep any of that in mind to get the answer\n        above. We can just start by looking in the ace's spot. What do we see?\n        The five. So next we go look at the five's spot. What do we see there?\n        The two. So we go look at the two's spot, and see the ace. Since the ace\n        is special, we go look for any other card we haven't seen yet, say in\n        the four's spot. Looking in there, we see the six. Looking at the six's\n        spot, we see the four, which is where we started. We have just read off\n        the same sequence:\n      </p>\n      <div>5, 2, 4, 6, 4</div>\n      <p>\n        So that's how we get the sequence of numbers that we need to memorize —\n        or in our case, write down. This is the main benefit (alluded to\n        earlier) of the method we've arrived at: every swap involves the ace's\n        spot, so we only need to keep track of the other half of the\n        information. With a small amount of practice, it's not very difficult to\n        read off this sequence of numbers from the initial cards without\n        physically moving any (trust me, practice for 15-20 minutes and it will\n        get significantly easier).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And the second benefit alluded to is that it simplifies the execution\n        phase, as there are less move sequences that we might be required to\n        perform. But we're only talking about the execution phase when\n        necessary, so we won't get into that here.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Transitioning from cards to a cube</h2>\n      <p>\n        Even if you don't see the appeal, and aren't entirely convinced that\n        it's easy, hopefully you at least believe that the above 6-card game is\n        not magic and that it's feasible for others to do (blindfolded). But\n        that was just a deck of playing cards — not even a deck, only six cards\n        — and a Rubik's Cube seems infinitely more complicated than that. So how\n        can the concepts above possibly transfer over? (You don't need a cube\n        for this next part, but it wouldn't hurt to have one on hand. Or use a{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://alg.cubing.net/?view=fullscreen\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          virtual cube\n        </a>\n        .)\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={solvedPhysical} alt=\"Solved cube\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={solvedVirtual} alt=\"Solved cube\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        Well, we need to make a few observations about Rubik's Cubes. Looking at\n        a solved cube, it has six sides and each side has nine stickers of the\n        same colour. Although it's not at all obvious, it turns out that\n        thinking of the cube this way is not helpful. If we take a cube apart,\n        we see it's actually made up of eight corner pieces, 12 edge pieces, and\n        one central core with six center pieces attached to it.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={somePieces} alt=\"Some pieces removed\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={allPieces} alt=\"All pieces removed\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={core} alt=\"The core\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        The first important observation is that the core and the six center\n        pieces never move relative to each other, they just spin around in\n        place. This means that if we pick up any edge piece, say the\n        yellow-green edge piece, then we know exactly where it needs to be\n        relative to the core: between the yellow center and the green center.\n        This also means that there is no green-blue edge: the green and blue\n        centers are opposite each other, and so there's no way to have an edge\n        piece touching both of them.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={solvedEdge}\n          alt=\"Edge which is solved\"\n        />\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={unsolvedEdge}\n          alt=\"Edge which is not solved\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        (Note: The cubes shown in this article have the standard/most common\n        colour-scheme, but of course some cubes may have different colour\n        schemes. Maybe the blue center is next to the green center on your cube,\n        or maybe there is another colour instead of green.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It's a similar story with the corners. If we pick up the\n        white-orange-green corner, then by finding the white, orange, and green\n        center pieces on the core, we can figure out exactly where the corner\n        belongs. Corners and edges behave slightly differently (and have\n        different amounts of stickers on them). But for our purposes, at this\n        point, those differences are irrelevant — there isn't a significant\n        conceptual difference between discussing corners and discussing edges.\n        So for now, we will only speak of edges. Just remember that everything\n        being discussed could equally well be applied to corners instead.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The key observation here is that the playing cards are analogous to the\n        edge pieces. We had six playing cards: they were laid out in a row, and\n        each could be correctly placed or in any other spot. It's a similar\n        story with our twelve edge pieces: there are twelve spots around the\n        core where each edge can be, and each edge can be in the correct spot or\n        in any other spot. The only catch is that an edge can be flipped — but\n        we'll get to that later, so just ignore that for now.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So how did we solve the playing cards problem? The ace's spot was\n        special; we swapped the card in that spot with wherever it needed to be.\n        This concept has a name: buffer. The ace's spot was our buffer. (The ace\n        is therefore referred to as the buffer card, though the buffer is much\n        more important than the buffer card.) So to apply the technique to the\n        cube, we will need a buffer. Let's use the white-green edge's spot as\n        our buffer, though any other spot would do just as well. (The\n        white-green edge is therefore our buffer piece.)\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={scrambledVirtual}\n          alt=\"Scrambled virtual cube\"\n        />\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={inPlaceEdge}\n          alt=\"Edge correctly placed\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        So suppose now that we have a scrambled cube. (I strongly recommending\n        visiting{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://alg.cubing.net/?setup=D_L2_U_F2_R2_D2_L2_D_L2_U_B-_R-_D_L-_U-_R-_D2_U_B_L-_R2_B-_U2_L-_B-_D-&view=fullscreen\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          this virtual cube\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        to see the scramble, as it allows you to drag it around and see all the\n        sides.) Since the center pieces cannot move relative to each other,\n        let's find the white and green centers. The spot between them is our\n        buffer. In the cube pictured above, the red-green edge is in the buffer.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        How many edges are correctly placed? Drag the cube around in the link\n        provided above. You should find that there is exactly one, namely the\n        green-orange edge. This can be seen in the second image above.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So how do we go about figuring out what to memorize? Well, let's just\n        try to imitate what we did with the playing cards. With those, we looked\n        at the card in the buffer, and that was the first thing we wrote down\n        before going and looking in that card's spot. In this scramble, the\n        red-green edge is in the buffer, so we want to start by writing down\n        \"red-green\" and then going and looking at the red-green edges spot (the\n        spot between the red center and the green center). Which edge is in the\n        that spot?\n      </p>\n      <img className=\"large-img\" src={seq2} alt=\"Red-green spot\" />\n      <p>\n        The white-blue edge is there. So we write down the white-blue edge, and\n        move on to looking at the white-blue spot. So far we have:\n      </p>\n      red-green, white-blue\n      <p>\n        We can do all this without thinking about swapping pieces around, but\n        remember that that is the underlying concept which this method is based\n        on. If we were to swap the buffer with the red-green spot and then swap\n        the buffer with the white-blue spot, then the red-green and white-blue\n        edges would be correctly placed on the cube, and the white-orange edge\n        would be in the buffer.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Continuing, we look at the white-blue spot (between the white center and\n        blue center).\n      </p>\n      <img className=\"large-img\" src={seq3} alt=\"Red-green spot\" />\n      <p>\n        We find the white-orange piece, which we write down, then continue on to\n        look at the spot between the white center and orange center. And so on.\n        If we continue this process (which I strongly recommend you do on the\n        virtual cube) then we eventually get to the red-yellow spot, at which\n        point we see the white-green piece. The white-green piece leads us to\n        the white-green spot, which is the buffer — we're back where we started.\n      </p>\n      <img className=\"large-img\" src={seq8} alt=\"Red-green spot\" />\n      <p>\n        Note that we don't want to write down the white-green piece at this\n        point. That's likely confusing the first time you see it — if so, go\n        back and revisit the card game in the previous section and notice how we\n        never wrote down the ace in any of our sequences (remember, the ace is\n        analogous to the white-green edge). Everything we write down in the list\n        is really an instruction to swap that with the white-green spot, and it\n        doesn't make sense to swap the white-green spot with itself!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So far we should have written down the following sequence of edge\n        pieces:\n      </p>\n      red-green, white-blue, white-orange, yellow-blue, yellow-orange, blue-red,\n      red-yellow\n      <p>\n        Thinking in swaps, this means that we just swapped the buffer (which at\n        that point contained the red-yellow edge) with the red-yellow spot\n        (which contained the white-green piece). So the white-green piece is\n        correctly placed, in the buffer. This is exactly analogous to the ace\n        being correctly placed in the first spot.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the card game, at such a point, we selected any card which was\n        incorrectly placed, and swapped the ace with that. So we need to find an\n        edge piece which is still incorrectly placed. Let's take the white-red\n        spot (which contains the orange-blue piece). We could just as easily\n        pick the green-yellow spot or the orange-blue spot, but not the\n        white-orange spot (because we had already dealt with it earlier in the\n        list) nor the green-orange spot (because that edge was already correctly\n        placed at the start).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Continuing through, we go from white-red to orange-blue to green-yellow,\n        finally back to white-red where we finish. Remember from the card game,\n        whenever we swap the ace with an incorrectly placed card, we ultimately\n        need to come back and finish off by swapping the ace back out of that\n        spot.\n      </p>\n      <p>So the full sequence we write down is:</p>\n      red-green, white-blue, white-orange, yellow-blue, yellow-orange, blue-red,\n      red-yellow, white-red, orange-blue, green-yellow, white-red\n      <p>\n        As mentioned, we could have made different choices when we picked the\n        white-red piece. So a different, but equally acceptable sequence (which\n        differs only in the final four items) could be:\n      </p>\n      red-green, white-blue, white-orange, yellow-blue, yellow-orange, blue-red,\n      red-yellow, green-yellow, white-red, orange-blue, green-yellow\n      <p>\n        This may seem tricky and confusing, but ideally at this point it\n        shouldn't seem like magic. It's not inherently difficult, but does\n        require a lot of practice to get used to it and to get to the point\n        where one can do it comfortably and consistently without making\n        mistakes.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Revsiting what it means to swap two pieces</h2>\n      <p>\n        There is a small catch here, one thing which we glossed over about the\n        cube and which wasn't an issue with the playing cards. No, it's nothing\n        particular to corners — remember that while we only discussed edges in\n        the previous section, the same logic and reasoning independently applies\n        to the corners. The issue is that an edge has two ways to be in the same\n        position.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={solvedEdge} alt=\"Solved edge\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={flippedEdge} alt=\"Flipped edge\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        In fact, there are two ways that we can swap the piece in the buffer\n        with another piece. (If you're thinking that there are four ways, then\n        you are in a sense correct, but the physical nature of the cube actually\n        make the other two impossible — but that's a story for another time.)\n        For example, there are two ways to swap the yellow-blue edge with the\n        blue-orange edge shown below: the first image is the initial setup, and\n        the next two images are the two possibilities.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={preSwap} alt=\"Before swapping\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={postSwap1} alt=\"Swap way 1\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={postSwap2} alt=\"Swap way 2\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        This isn't actually a problem — it just means that we need to be more\n        careful about what we mean by swapping two pieces. You may notice that\n        we have always referred to the buffer as the white-green spot, and never\n        the green-white spot. This is very intentional, and is an important\n        point. When we write the first item in the list as red-green (as in the\n        previous section), we mean swap the white-green spot with the red-green\n        spot so that the white sticker (of white-green) ends up where the red\n        sticker (of red-green) was, and vice-versa (first image below). If we\n        had instead written the first thing on the list as green-red, then that\n        would be telling us to swap the white sticker (of white-green) with the\n        green sticker (of green-red), which we can see is not the desired effect\n        (second image below).\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={correctSwap} alt=\"Correct swap\" />\n        <img className=\"small-img\" src={incorrectSwap} alt=\"Incorrect swap\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        This may make the whole method seem more complicated and annoying, and\n        it certainly does (at least at first), but hopefully you're still\n        convinced that there is nothing magical or inexplicable about it — that\n        somebody could, with enough practice, be able to do it.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Brief notes on the execution phase</h2>\n      <p>\n        As mentioned earlier, there are multiple different ways to go about the\n        execution phase, but the memorization phase is relatively independent of\n        which execution method we pick (which is why we are able to largely\n        avoid talking about execution). But let's briefly think about it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If we have written down a list of swaps to make with the buffer, how\n        would we execute that? Well, there are 11 edges besides the buffer, and\n        as discussed there are two ways to swap with each edge, which means\n        there are 22 possible swaps. (Similarly there are 7 non-buffer corners\n        and three ways to swap each, for a total of 21 possible swaps). So if we\n        somehow magically knew 22 different sequences of moves, one for each\n        possible edge swap we might need to do, then we could just do the\n        appropriate sequence of moves for each item on the list we wrote down.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In a way, this sounds very complicated, because how could we possibly\n        know and remember those move sequences. On the other hand, if you accept\n        that it's possible to know those 22 move sequences, then it's actually\n        quite simple: we just execute a pre-determined move sequence for each\n        item in the list we write down, in order. Notice that this makes the\n        execution phase relatively free of thinking. There's no need to keep a\n        mental picture of what the cube looks like or keep track of where\n        particular pieces are as they move around. Nor do we need to actively\n        think about the rest of the list besides the item we are currently\n        dealing with.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Just like we are writing down our sequence of edges instead of\n        memorizing them, we could write down instructions for how to perform\n        these 22 move sequences (\"Case green-red: spin the top a quarter turn\n        clockwise, then the right side half the way around, ...\"). With these\n        two pieces of information (sequence of edge pieces for the specific\n        scramble, and general list of 22 move sequences) written down in front\n        of us, we could solve the cube — or at least, the edges — relatively\n        easily.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And this is almost exactly what the common beginner execution methods\n        do: they know 22 pre-determined move sequences, and apply the\n        appropriate one at each step. (More advanced execution methods deal with\n        these swaps in pairs and actually do two at once, and there are\n        intermediate methods in between. All very interesting, but not the focus\n        of this article.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now, there is again a small catch. It's actually impossible to swap two\n        edges while leaving every other piece undisturbed. So it sounds like\n        this was all for nothing. But fortunately, there is a work-around.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What we will do is, every time we swap the buffer with another edge's\n        spot, we will also swap two corner spots. The key point here is that\n        while we will be swapping the buffer with a different edge spot every\n        time, we will be swapping the exact same two corner spots every time. So\n        after the first edge swap, two corners will be swapped from how there\n        were originally. But after the second edge swap, they will be swapped\n        back and it will be as if nothing ever happened, which is perfect. So in\n        a sense, we don't even need to worry about this corner-swapping\n        side-effect; everything will sort itself out even if we aren't aware of\n        it.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Coming next: Parity</h2>\n      <p>\n        If you think about it for a while though, you may realize that there's a\n        potential problem. What if we have to do an odd number of edge swaps —\n        say 5 edges swaps? Then the two corners that we keep swapping back and\n        forth will not end up back in their original positions. Unfortunately,\n        this is possible. And in fact, it will happen (exactly) half of the\n        time. This is known as 'having parity' in the cubing world, and is the\n        focus of the next article in this series.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The scramble we went through above actually has parity. If we do the\n        sequence of edge swaps above then we'll end up with two corners (say the\n        two corners on the top right) swapped. Comparing the corners on the two\n        images here, we see that just those two have changed.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"image-row\">\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={scrambledVirtual}\n          alt=\"Scrambled cube\"\n        />\n        <img\n          className=\"small-img\"\n          src={solvedEdges}\n          alt=\"Edge solved but two corners swapped\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        In turns out that we can deal with this issue either in the execution\n        phase or in the memorization phase — or a combination of both — and this\n        is what makes things interesting. Of course, if you're willing to just\n        give up on half of the scrambles and retry until you get one with an\n        even number of swaps, then you can just stop here. But that wouldn't be\n        very satisfying would it?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Next article in this series:{\" \"}\n        {/*\n        <a href=\"TOD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n          title TBD, link TBD\n        </a> */}\n        TBD.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n      <p>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006GARR01\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          Lucas Garron\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        created the virtual cube linked to in this article.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I almost certainly got the idea for using playing cards as a teaching\n        tool from{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012ARTH01?event=333bf\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          Noah Arthurs\n        </a>\n        '{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://youtu.be/JJWl-FDetWE\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          video\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        in which he does the same thing.

But it can also be quite difficult to do it right,\n        especially if you're new to React. It's one thing to watch a video or\n        read a tutorial which explains how to do something, but it's another\n        thing to take those techniques and apply them to your own unique\n        situation. Often, those techniques won't directly apply, and there are\n        several possible ways to proceed but it's not clear which is best -- or\n        there are no clear ways to proceed. Or, worst of all, it seems like the\n        a technique applies, but unbeknownst to you, it's a poor way to do it\n        and there is actually a much better solution.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This piece is not intended to be a tutorial or guide; there are many\n        resources out there on React and state management if that's what you're\n        looking for. While we will (briefly) discuss state from sratch, there\n        are lots of important things about state (and hooks) which we won't\n        mention at all. This post will probably be most useful to you if you've\n        already learnt the basics of React state management and have tried to\n        create a toy project on your own, but don't yet have a complete grasp --\n        otherwise, I would recommend finding a different resource. Although,\n        ultimately, this post is probably most useful to me; the process of\n        writing something down and explaining it is the best way to confirm and\n        solidify ones understanding.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In this post, rather than just showing multiple examples of state\n        management done well and explaining some conclusions, we'll actually\n        walk through all the \"incorrect\" things that I personally did on my way\n        to getting to those conclusions. I'll explain what I was doing at each\n        stage, what problem I was trying to solve, and why it was a bad solution\n        for that problem. This will be done with reference to the game Connect\n        4, though the concepts apply to most other situations (games or \"real\"\n        applications) with sufficient thought. (Minesweeper and Othello are a\n        good examples to have in mind.) Note, however, that some of the earlier\n        problems actually came up in prior projects of mine (Tic-tac-toe and\n        Minesweeper), but I've reframed them all in terms of Connect 4 for\n        simplicity. Also, the order that we'll go through the problems here is\n        very slightly different from the order that I actually encountered them\n        in. This is to avoid distinct trains of thought from getting\n        unnecessarily tangled together, and to make it easier to follow along.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I should note that I learnt everything I know about React (which I've\n        been using for several months at this point) by watching videos, reading\n        articles, and creating my own independent web apps (hosted on GitHub\n        Pages). I didn't take any courses, formal or informal. While this has\n        many drawbacks, one of the largest benefits is that you really\n        appreciate a technique when you finally discover or understand it after\n        doing it wrong or using a worse technique for many days, weeks, or even\n        months. It really puts the technique into perspective, much more so than\n        a teacher telling it to you from the start when you haven't struggled\n        with the alternatives.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Finally, be aware that I'm no expert with React; I don't have all the\n        answers. Some of the answers that I think I have might actually be the\n        wrong answers. So don't just blindly accept everything I say here. And\n        please let me know if anything in this post is incorrect or misleading,\n        so that I can correct/update it.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>State Basics</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        As I mentioned, I'll be assuming you know a bit about React and state.\n        But here is a very brief summary. Note that this may not be entirely\n        technically accurate, but it functions sufficiently as a high-level\n        model to have in your mind.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In React, we can pretend we're writing HTML and JavaScript (though\n        technically we're writing in JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript).\n        This means that we can define values using <code>const</code> and{\" \"}\n        <code>let</code>. The former type cannot be mutated (changed), but the\n        latter can. If we do reassign a <code>let</code> value, and are\n        displaying that value on the web page we're building, then the change\n        won't show up -- the original value will still be shown.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is because React takes the content to be displayed, renders it onto\n        the screen, and only updates the screen (know as re-rendering) under\n        certain conditions. Otherwise, it would be constantly re-rendering as it\n        steps through any calculation in our code, which is very inefficient.\n        Moreover, when it does re-render, it essentially renders from scratch,\n        meaning that the <code>let</code> value we changed via a function call\n        is actually back to its original value. (Of course, behind the scenes\n        React is smart and can avoid re-rendering parts which it knows haven't\n        changed, but that's not relevant to us right now.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The classic example here is a value which tracks how many times a user\n        has clicked a button. If the page displays that value, and the button\n        updates that value (inreases it by one) then the page will not reflect\n        the update because it hasn't re-rendered. And if the page is later\n        re-rendered, that updated value will be lost. So the number of clicks\n        will always display as 0 (the initial value in your code).\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"let count = 0;\\n\"}\n          {\"function clickHandler() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  count += 1;\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n          {\"<button onClick={clickHandler}>Increment</button>;\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        The exception to this re-render from scratch policy is state. Anything\n        defined with state (known as stateful, as opposed to stateless) will not\n        revert back to its original value on re-render; it will maintain its\n        most recent value. And updating a state is one thing which triggers\n        React to re-render, so we're basically guaranteed that the screen is\n        showing the correct value of anything which is stateful. (Technically,\n        React may batch re-renders together behind the scenes, for efficiency.\n        But again, that optimization shouldn't be too important for what we're\n        thinking about here.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        These days, with functional components introduced a few years ago, the\n        main way to bring state into our code is via hooks like{\" \"}\n        <code>useState</code>. Instead of bringing this in with the\n        click-counter above, let's go straight into Connect 4.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Connect 4 Game Values</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        I'll assume you're familiar with the game Connect 4 (if not, there are\n        surely numerous videos and articles out there which explain it).\n        Briefly, it is played on a stand-up 6x7 (rows by columns) board where\n        two players take turns dropping pieces (via gravity) into columns, until\n        somebody wins by getting a line of 4 (in any direction, including\n        diagonally) or the board fills up (a draw).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What values do we need to keep track of in order to create a working\n        version of this game? That is, values that we would pass to our View\n        components to display the game to the user(s). Well, we obviously need\n        to know the location of the pieces. So the board is a value. The board\n        would presumably be a matrix (array of arrays) with each entry\n        indicating whether the spot is empty, or which player has a piece there.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// a possible board\\n\"}\n          {\"// note the first row is the bottom, so this looks upside-down\\n\"}\n          {\"[\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, 0,    1,    1,    0,    null],\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, 1,    0,    null, null, null],\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, null, 0,    null, null, null],\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, null, null, null, null, null],\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, null, null, null, null, null],\\n\"}\n          {\"  [null, null, null, null, null, null, null],\\n\"}\n          {\"];\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        We also need to know whos turn it is. And the status of the game -- is\n        it ongoing, has somebody won (if so, who), or is it a draw? These three\n        values -- the board, the status of the game, and whos turn it is -- seem\n        to be enough to make things work. If a player wants to make a move, we\n        can check that the game is ongoing and that it's their turn, then add\n        their piece to the board (assuming the column they picked isn't full).\n        Otherwise, if somebody has won, we can display a message to that effect.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// a possible game status\\n\"}\n          {'\"ongoing\";\\n'}\n          {\"// a possible whos turn is next\\n\"}\n          {\"1;\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This is indeed enough, but there are a couple of other values we might\n        consider also tracking. First, it would be visually nice to highlight\n        the 4 pieces that a player won with at the end of the game (unless of\n        course the result was a draw). This just improves the user experience,\n        but doesn't increase functionality. Second, we could store a list\n        (stack) of all the moves made in the game, in order. This would be\n        necessary if we wanted to add an undo feature; with just the board, game\n        status, and whos turn it is, we don't know which was the most recent\n        piece to be dropped in. So this doesn't impact the user experience\n        directly, but it does open the door to additional functionality.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Introducing State</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        With roughly the model described above guiding me, my first thought was\n        to make all of the game values stateful, because if we need to update\n        something then it should be stateful. This turns out not to be entirely\n        correct -- maybe you can already see a better approach. At the time, it\n        didn't even occur to me that there might be alternatives. But we're\n        walking through ideas more or less as I thought them, so we'll stick\n        with this for now and see where it gets us.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To do this, we import <code>useState</code> and make our three values --\n        the board, the game status, and whos turn it is -- stateful. Note that\n        these values are constants (denoted by <code>const</code>), which means\n        we can't change their values. But we can make sure they start with\n        different values on re-renders, by passing that new value to the setter\n        function returned by <code>useState</code> -- we'll get to this in the\n        next section.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"const [board, setBoard] = useState(emptyBoard(6, 7));\\n\"}\n          {'const [gameStatus, setGameStatus] = useState(\"ongoing\");\\n'}\n          {\"const [toPlayNext, setToPlayNext] = useState(firstPlayer);\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Note that <code>firstPlayer</code> is a parameter, and{\" \"}\n        <code>emptyBoard</code> is a helper function.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Notice that including move history (which, recall, would be necessary if\n        we wanted to later implement an undo feature) is easy, so we'll do that.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// a possible move history, corresponding to the above game\\n\"}\n          {\"[\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 0, row: 0, col: 5 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 1, row: 0, col: 4 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 0, row: 0, col: 2 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 1, row: 0, col: 3 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 0, row: 1, col: 3 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 1, row: 1, col: 2 },\\n\"}\n          {\"  { player: 0, row: 2, col: 3 },\\n\"}\n          {\"];\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <pre>\n        <code>{\"const [moveHistory, setMoveHistory] = useState([]);\\n\"}</code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <h2>Updating a State</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        So what happens when a player clicks on a column to drop a piece into it\n        (assuming the game is ongoing and it's their turn)? It seems pretty\n        simple; we just update all the states. For now, let's just focus on the\n        board state.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Well, the player selected a column. We can use a helper function to find\n        which row the piece will end up in when dropping into that column. Note\n        that this function implicitly depends on the board constant (it's not\n        passed into the function as a parameter), which may be a different value\n        on each re-render. So this function is actually a different function on\n        each re-render. (It also depends on <code>rows</code>, how many rows the\n        board has.)\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function findEmptyRow(col) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    if (board[row][col] === null) {\\n\"}\n          {\"      return row;\\n\"}\n          {\"    }\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"  return null;\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Now, given the player, row, and column, we need to actually update the\n        board state. Since the board is a constant, we can't change its value,\n        but it is an array so we can change its contents. Then we could pass it\n        to the board setter.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    board[row][col] = player;\\n\"}\n          {\"    setBoard(board);\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\"}\n          {\"}\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This won't work. There's a slight catch with setters; they only trigger\n        a re-render if the value they receive is different from the current\n        state, and this is checked by reference. Even though an entry in the\n        array has changed, it's still the same array reference and so React\n        won't trigger a re-render.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The standard solution here (as far as I know) is to make a shallow copy\n        of the array, and then proceed with that:\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    newBoard = [...board];\\n\"}\n          {\"    newBoard[row][col] = player;\\n\"}\n          {\"    setBoard(newBoard);\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\"}\n          {\"}\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This is a bit annoying, and if we had to conditionally update multiple\n        pieces on the board (such as in other games like Minesweeper or\n        Othello), then we would be repeating these few lines of code often. This\n        indicates that we should encapsulate the logic into the setter if\n        possible. That's not directly possible, but we can accomplish this if we\n        use a different hook instead of <code>useState</code>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Using Dispatchers Instead of Setters</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Instead of using the <code>useState</code> hook, we'll use the{\" \"}\n        <code>useReducer</code> hook. Where the former produces a setter\n        function which needs the new value, the latter produces a dispatch\n        function which needs an action. So instead of each time making a shallow\n        copy, modifying it, and then passing it to the setter, we can just call\n        the dispatcher with the action \"place a piece for this player in this\n        row and this column\" and encapsulate the shallow copy code within. This\n        has the additional benefit of preventing the state from being modified\n        in an unnatural way (for instance, we would never delete a row of pieces\n        in this game, and nobody would be able to do that because we wouldn't\n        program the dispatcher to recognize/perform such an action).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Note that we need to supply a reducer function to{\" \"}\n        <code>useReducer</code>, so that the dispatcher knows what to do with\n        each action. This reducer function will be given the old state as an\n        argument, as well as the action which we pass to the dispatcher.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function reduceBoard(state, action) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  switch (action.type) {\\n\"}\n          {'    case \"drop\":\\n'}\n          {\"      newState = [...state];\\n\"}\n          {\"      newState[action.row][action.col] = action.player;\\n\"}\n          {\"      return newState;\\n\"}\n          {\"    default:\\n\"}\n          {\"      return state;\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"const [board, dispatchBoard] = useReducer(reduceBoard, emptyBoard(6, 7));\\n\"\n          }\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        The <code>placePiece</code> function is now shorter and easier to\n        understand.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {'    dispatchBoard({ type: \"drop\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        We can also change the move history from a setter to a dispatcher, since\n        it also needs to make a shallow copy.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>A Sequence of Setters and Dispatchers</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Our <code>placePiece</code> function, which would be called when a\n        player makes a move, so far only adds that piece to the appropriate spot\n        on the board. It still needs to update the everything else: the game\n        status, whos playing next, and the move history.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Since we also switched the move history from a setter to a dispatcher in\n        the previous section, it's easy enough to also update that:\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {'    dispatchBoard({ type: \"drop\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {'    dispatchHistory({ type: \"add\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Whos turn is next seems like it should be easy, as we just flip it to\n        the opposite player, but it's actually not that simple because the game\n        might be over. If the game is over, there is no next turn, so the value\n        should be null. (We don't have to do this I suppose, but it seems like\n        the best practice in this case.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So we'd better update the game status first, since whos turn is next\n        depends on that. It's easy but tedious to write a some helper functions\n        -- which, like the earlier helper to find the empty row, implicitly\n        depend on the board constant -- to help decide what the new game status\n        should be, by checking if there are 4 pieces in a row, and whether the\n        board is full.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {'    dispatchBoard({ type: \"drop\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {'    dispatchHistory({ type: \"add\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {\"    if (isWon()) {\\n\"}\n          {\"      setGameStatus(player);\\n\"}\n          {\"    } else if (isDraw()) {\\n\"}\n          {'      setGameStatus(\"draw\");\\n'}\n          {\"    }\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        The problem is, this won't work -- it won't detect a winner. This is\n        quite confusing if you're new to state management. If you're familiar\n        with functional programming, that might help you understand what is\n        going on here. Essentially, when the user clicks on a column, triggering\n        the <code>placePiece</code> function to be called, a closure is created.\n        This closure contains the values of all constants at the time the\n        function was called, including the definition of <code>isWon</code>{\" \"}\n        which depends on the board. Even though the third line of the function\n        calls the dispatcher which leads to the board constant being updated and\n        the page being re-rendered, within the evaluation of the{\" \"}\n        <code>placePiece</code> function the closure still has the original\n        value of board from when the user clicked. It's this old board value\n        which is used by the <code>isWon</code> helper, and so{\" \"}\n        <code>isWon</code> is working perfectly but is just checking the wrong\n        board. (And no, we can't try and make the board an explicit parameter to\n        the <code>isWon</code> helper because that function's parameters are\n        also part of the closure -- we'll have the same problem.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This seems like a huge problem. If we want to update a sequence of\n        states, later updates can't really depend on earlier updates. This\n        didn't cause a problem with updating the board and updating the move\n        history, because neither of those depends on the other. But the game\n        status update most definitely does depend on the board update.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One way around this problem is to call a helper function which\n        acknowledges that it has the old state, and takes into account that it\n        needs to pretend that there is a new piece when checking for a win or\n        draw. This would work, but it seems a bit ridiculous -- why are we\n        essentially updating the board twice (once for real, and once\n        temporarily within this helper)? This is not a good solution at all.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a side note, for similar reasons, reducers (passed into{\" \"}\n        <code>useReducer</code>) should be pure -- that is, not have an implicit\n        dependence on values which might change. They should produce the same\n        result from the same arguments, regardless of external values having\n        changed. This is most easily achieved by placing the definition of each\n        reducer outside the function body which it is used in -- now an error\n        immediately comes up if you try to use values which may change. This was\n        actually a big point of confusion for me for a time, but I've relegated\n        it to a brief paragraph here without elaborating.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Adding Effects to the Sequence</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        After we update the board and the move history, all following state\n        updates depend on those initial two states in some form -- they are side\n        effects. This points us towards the <code>useEffect</code> hook. Unlike\n        the other hooks we've used so far, this doesn't setup and update a\n        stateful value. Rather, it is used to run side effects after other\n        values are updated.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So let's move the code to update the game status out of{\" \"}\n        <code>placePiece</code> and into a side effect.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {'    dispatchBoard({ type: \"drop\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {'    dispatchHistory({ type: \"add\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n          {\"useEffect(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (isWon()) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    setGameStatus(player);\\n\"}\n          {\"  } else if (isDraw()) {\\n\"}\n          {'    setGameStatus(\"draw\");\\n'}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        A side effect like this will run after every re-render of the page (and\n        on the initial render). So whenever the board is updated via a\n        dispatcher in <code>placePiece</code>, this side effect will be\n        triggered and the game status will be updated. The key point is that\n        since these side effects are triggered after re-renders, their closures\n        are created with the up-to-date values of board and so on.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We might still run into the same problem of having old state values in\n        the closure, if we call multiple setters or dispatchers in a single\n        effect, just like in the old <code>placePiece</code>. But if that's the\n        case, we can likely just split those calls into individual side effects\n        -- use a sequence of side effects, each doing one update, instead of one\n        side effect doing a sequence of updates.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Since these side effects run after each re-render, if they do update a\n        stateful value and therefore trigger another re-render, they will be run\n        again. If we do something convoluted, we may end up in an infinite loop\n        of re-renders. But if we do something reasonable like update the game\n        status state based on the board state, then the board state will be the\n        same on that second render and so the second call to the effect will\n        produce the same game status value, meaning no re-render is triggered\n        (recall setters and dispatchers won't trigger a re-render if they are\n        passed the same value that the state already has).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Recall where we are at this point. When a user clicks a column to place\n        a piece, <code>placePiece</code> is called. This function dispatches\n        updates to the board and move history. These trigger the side effect we\n        just added, which updates the game status. We still need to update whos\n        turn is next.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For updating whos turn is next, recall that usually we just want to flip\n        the value to the opposite player. However in the event that the game has\n        ended we want to set it to null (again, this is not strictly speaking\n        necessary, but it is the most logical). Since this update does depend on\n        the stateful values we've just updated, we can't just do this change\n        after in the <code>placePiece</code> function -- that doesn't have\n        access to the updated game status value. So let's put it in a side\n        effect.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"useEffect(() => {\\n\"}\n          {'  if (gameStatus === \"ongoing\") {\\n'}\n          {\"    setGameStatus(1 - gameStatus);\\n\"}\n          {\"  } else {\\n\"}\n          {\"    setGameStatus(null);\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This causes some problems. This side effect runs after every re-render,\n        but we only want to update this once after the user clicks. This wasn't\n        a problem in the first side effect, because updating the game status\n        multiple times after a move would always return the same value. But this\n        update involves toggling a value (assuming the game is ongoing), so\n        doing it multiple times is (typically) not the same as doing it once.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Fortunately, we can stop a side effect from running every re-render by\n        additionally giving it an array. The side effect will only run after a\n        re-render if one of the values in that array changes. However, if we use\n        this feature, we need to include all stateful variables being referenced\n        in the side effect (otherwise React won't update them at all and they\n        will have old values, analogous to the closure issues earlier). So we\n        must include the game status in this array.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"useEffect(() => {\\n\"}\n          {'  if (gameStatus === \"ongoing\") {\\n'}\n          {\"    setGameStatus(1 - gameStatus);\\n\"}\n          {\"  } else {\\n\"}\n          {\"    setGameStatus(null);\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}, [gameStatus]);\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        The problem now is that if a player makes a move and the game isn't over\n        (they didn't win or draw on that move), then the game status doesn't\n        change (it's still ongoing), so this side effect won't be called. It\n        needs to happen every time the <code>palcePiece</code> function is\n        called, and only happen once each time. If we add the board to the\n        dependency array, then this side effect will happen after we update the\n        board. (It will run again if the game status changes because of that\n        board update, but that will only change at the end of the game, at which\n        point there is no more toggling and we just want the value to be null.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So that seems to work. But it feels a bit fragile -- fundamentally, we\n        want to change this value when the user does something in particular,\n        not when other values change. If we later change things, to the point\n        that the board is updated multiple times, or there are new possible game\n        states, then this would break right away. It doesn't sound likely in\n        Connect 4, but analogous things can happen in other games like\n        Minesweeper and Othello. Though in fact, it is possible in Connect 4. We\n        could add a \"forfeit\" game status (more on this later), or the board\n        could be updated more times if it stores additional information (more on\n        this now).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Recall that we briefly mentioned the possibility of adding highlights\n        earlier, to highlight 4 pieces when a player wins. Let's bring that in\n        now. There are many ways to do this. The highlights could be a list of\n        pieces to highlight -- but this is awkward to pass to the View component\n        as it then has to check through the list each time it displays a single\n        piece. So it seems best to be in a matrix structure just like the board.\n        And if that's the case, then it may as well be combined with the board.\n        (More on this combining vs keeping separate aspect later.)\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\n            \"// a possible board (only first row shown -- other rows omitted for brevity)\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"[\\n\"}\n          {\"  [\\n\"}\n          {\"    // row 0\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: null, isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 1,    isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: null, isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"  ],\\n\"}\n          {\"  // rows 1 through 5 would be here\\n\"}\n          {\"];\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Back to the side effect we were just discussing. Since the highlights\n        are now stored in the board, this side effect may be triggered again if\n        the highlights are updated separately from the piece being placed into\n        the board. If this were to happen, then the side effect would toggle\n        whos turn is next too frequently, meaning that in fact this isn't going\n        to work as is.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Removing Most State</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        As always, there are multiple ways to go about fixing things. Maybe\n        combining the game status and whos turn is next into one value would be\n        best -- instead of \"ongoing\" as a status, we could indicate whos turn is\n        next, and when the game isn't ongoing we don't need to know whos turn is\n        next.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        That would likely help. And there are other similar approaches. But\n        there is one core thing which we've been doing this whole time:\n        over-using state.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The key observation is actually extremely simple -- you may have\n        realized it right at the start of this post (but unfortunately I\n        didn't). And that is that if a value can be calculated from another\n        value, then it doesn't need to be stateful -- it can be a stateless\n        constant. (It might still make sense to be stateful in some situations,\n        but we'll get to that later.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The only state that we really need, if you think about it, is the move\n        history. Everything else can be derived from that. The board can be\n        created from that by starting with an empty matrix and iterating through\n        the history, dropping pieces into the columns (basically simulating the\n        game from the beginning). The game status can be calculated from this\n        board directly, defined as a stateless constant -- there's no need to\n        make it stateful. Whos turn is next can be directly calculated from the\n        game status and the last move in the move history.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\n            \"const [moveHistory, dispatchHistory] = useReducer(reduceHistory, []);\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"const board = applyMoves(emptyBoard(6, 7));\\n\"}\n          {\n            'const gameStatus = isWon() ? findWinner() : isDraw() ? \"draw\" : \"ongoing\";\\n'\n          }\n          {\"const toPlayNext =\\n\"}\n          {'  gameStatus !== \"ongoing\"\\n'}\n          {\"    ? null\\n\"}\n          {\"    : moveHistory.length === 0\\n\"}\n          {\"    ? firstPlayer\\n\"}\n          {\"    : 1 - moveHistory[moveHistory.length - 1].player;\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Note that many of the helper functions (<code>applyMoves</code>, etc.)\n        will implicitly use the move history value.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        These constants will have the correct values when we use them, because\n        whenever the move history is updated via the dispatcher, the page is\n        re-rendered and all (non-stateful) constants are calculated from\n        scratch, using the up-to-date move history.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In a way, we're not actually doing much different. The calculation for\n        the game status, based on the board, is the same. But instead of\n        manually updating it when the user clicks, or instead of automatically\n        updating it via a side effect when the board state changes, we just\n        calculate it each time as the definition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Basically, we used too much state. We tried to manually manage a bunch\n        of stuff which can happen naturally and automatically. Using less state\n        simplifies a lot. Looking at the definitions (above) of these constants,\n        we can easily understand what they are: we don't have to go looking for\n        setters or dispatchers or side effects to figure out when they update;\n        we just look at the defintion (and any helper functions used in the\n        definition). The <code>placePiece</code> function also becames extremely\n        simple. Just update the move history, and everything else is calculated\n        correctly on re-render -- no side-effects necessary.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function placePiece(col, player) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  row = findEmptyRow(col);\\n\"}\n          {\"  if (row !== null) {\\n\"}\n          {'    dispatchHistory({ type: \"add\", player, row, col });\\n'}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <h2>Reintroducing Some More State</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        The only potential problem here is that we are doing a lot of extra\n        work. Every time the user makes a move, the move history is updated, and\n        then the board is calculated from scratch. In a small, 2-player game\n        like this, that's almost certainly irrelevant (though I'm not an expert\n        on efficiency, so I could be wrong here). But in a large, complex\n        setting, computing everything from scratch on each re-render might not\n        be a good idea. So, for the sake of learning, we'll assume that Connect\n        4 is a large complex game and computing from scratch is a bad idea.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are hooks which we can use to prevent unneeded computations --\n        these make sure a constant is only recalculated on re-render if there's\n        a chance its value might change. But that doesn't help us here because\n        we know the board value will change when the user makes a move. The only\n        way (as far as I know) to prevent re-calculating the board each time a\n        move is made is to make the board stateful and use the previous state to\n        build the new state (via a dispatcher). But this is exactly what we had\n        originally when everything was stateful. We're not going back to\n        everything being stateful though -- just the move history and the board\n        at this point.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This is more efficient, because when a move is made, we calculate the\n        new board from the old board, which just involves making a shallow copy\n        and updating one cell, as opposed to iterating through the whole move\n        history and adding each to a fresh board. (Keep in mind, this isn't a\n        great example as far as being worthwhile of this optimization -- think\n        of Othello instead, where on each move, we may need to flip multiple\n        pieces, and pretend the Othello board is extremely large.)\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>When to use Stateful Values</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        So when should a value be stateful, and when should it be a stateless\n        constant calculated from other constants (which themselves may be\n        stateful or stateless)? Well, as far as I understand, it more or less\n        comes down to what we mentioned with the game status in the previous\n        section.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If the value is easy to directly calculate from other (stateful or\n        stateless) values, then just do that and make it stateless. This is good\n        because it's simple and we never need to worry about whether the value\n        is up-to-date.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If the value cannot be calculated from other values, or is significantly\n        easier to calculate using its old value, then make is stateful. This is\n        annoying because we need to make sure it stays up-to-date via a side\n        effect, or via dispatchs within other functions. And that itself is not\n        ideal because we don't automatically know where to find those side\n        effects and dispatches if we just look at the definition. But it may be\n        necessary and/or more efficient.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The move history, for example, cannot be calculated from other values --\n        the fact that a move was made needs to be stored somewhere! So that's\n        stateful. The board can be calculated from the move history, but would\n        be much easier with access the previous board state. So it could be\n        stateless, but we'll make it stateful. The game status can be easily\n        calculated from the board (especially if we also use the move history to\n        only check the most recently placed piece for the win condition), and\n        having the old game status doesn't help calculate the new one, so make\n        that stateless. Whos turn is next is easy to calculate from the move\n        history (except if the move history is empty, in which case we need to\n        be told, likely via a parameter supplied when the whole setup was\n        instantiated -- but that's not a problem) so that can be stateless.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Finally, note that if we introduce new features later, we may (or may\n        not) need to adjust some of these decisions. For instance, if we later\n        add a forfeit feature, then the game status can no longer be calculated\n        directly from the board -- if somebody forfeits, then the board appears\n        to show an ongoing game, but in reality there is a winner and a loser.\n        So while game status was originally a stateless value, it may need to be\n        turned into a stateful value. (Though there are other solutions which\n        keep the game status as stateless.) Another example to consider would be\n        adding an undo feature, to take back the most recent move.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Combining vs Separating Values</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        You may have noticed that the one thing we didn't mention in the\n        previous section was the highlights (highlighting 4 pieces once a player\n        has won). As mentioned earlier on, the highlights are combined into the\n        board, because that makes it very smooth and easy for the View component\n        to display the board.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\n            \"// a possible board (only first row shown -- other rows omitted for brevity)\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"[\\n\"}\n          {\"  [\\n\"}\n          {\"    // row 0\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: null, isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 1,    isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: 0,    isHighlight: true  },\\n\"}\n          {\"    { player: null, isHighlight: false },\\n\"}\n          {\"  ],\\n\"}\n          {\"  // rows 1 through 5 would be here\\n\"}\n          {\"];\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Making things easy for the view is good. But it does complicate our\n        logic, because we only want to look for pieces to highlight if somebody\n        has won the game, but we don't know if somebody has won the game until\n        we calculate the game status, which is done based on the board. Things\n        are getting circular here. We could just always check whether there are\n        pieces to highlight, but that's not very satisfactory (and in other\n        situations, may be impractical or inefficient).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We might be able to mess around with some side effects to get this\n        working, but it would likely be unpleasant if it works. To me, it seemed\n        better to separate the pieces and the highlights into two separate\n        values: have a pieces matrix and a (separate) highlights matrix. This\n        seems a bit less ideal for the view, as we are now passing it two\n        matrices which is combines to display. This itself isn't a problem, but\n        it's generally better if the View does less logic rather than more.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        However, we can still have a board value and just pass that to the View.\n        It can be a stateless constant, calculated directly from the pieces and\n        highlights values. Or, it can be a stateful constant, with a side effect\n        to recalculate it when either of those matrices updates. (We've just\n        discussed the trade-offs between these two options in the previous\n        section.) Now the view still has access to the single board constant.\n        And in our chain of updates after a user makes a move, we can update the\n        pieces, then the game status (and whos turn is next), then the\n        highlights (if necessary), and finally combine the pieces and highlights\n        into the board -- all without any issues or circular reasoning.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Later, if we want to add more data to the board, we can just create a\n        new matrix (stateless or stateful, as discussed earlier) and easily\n        modify the board function to also merge this new matrix in along with\n        the pieces and the highlights. And the View still has consistent access\n        to the single board matrix to display however it needs to.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Custom Hooks</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        In my journey, custom hooks actually came much closer to the beginning.\n        Although I was doing most of the above sections in the context of a\n        custom hook, it didn't make a significant difference in what we were\n        discussing, so I omitted that detail. I've left custom hooks for the end\n        because they kind of interrupted the chain of thought above, which would\n        have just reduced clarity.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Wherever this Connect 4 game is being used/played, it probably has a lot\n        of other stuff going on: setting up the players, figuring out their\n        names and colours, matching up people to play, etc. There is a decent\n        amount of code just to cover all the logic we're discussed already (most\n        of which I didn't even show in this post, because it wasn't necessary),\n        and it's not helpful to crowd it in this one main file.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I recognized this early on, but at first didn't understand how to deal\n        with the problem. We need the board and other values in the main file,\n        to pass to the View and other components. If we define them elsewhere,\n        then we no longer have access to them. Of course, we can import\n        functions and values to the main file. But importing these values and\n        functions individually won't work; they need some global parameters to\n        get setup, and only work together as a unit.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The solution, which again may seem natural if you're familiar with\n        functional programming, is to indeed put them all in a separate file,\n        but then wrap them into a single function which returns all the constans\n        and functions which we need. We can then import that function in the\n        main file, and supply it with the global parameters when we call it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This, it turns out, is called a custom hook, and the name should start\n        with \"use\".

What constants does the View need to have in order to display the\n        relevant information, and what functionality does it need to have when\n        the user interacts with it? Of course, we may not answer this question\n        perfectly (especially if we don't fully understand our View yet), but we\n        should get most of it right.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In our case, it needs the board (inclusive of pieces and highlights),\n        the game status, and whose turn is next to display to the user.

It may also, depending on the situation, need\n        a function to reset the board for a new game. And maybe an undo\n        function. So before even writing any logic, we could start with this\n        return line. It might change later on, but probably not too much. And\n        even if it does, it gives us a direction to work in, in the meantime.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function useGame(firstPlayer) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  // TODO: define constants and helpers\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {\n            \"  return { board, gameStatus, toPlayNext, placePiece, reset, undo };\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Even if we think we need to keep track of the move history, the View\n        most likely won't need that, so it's not in the return. We can define\n        non-returned things (like the move history)s inside the hook as we go\n        when they become necessary.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Given our initial intended return values (constants and functions), we\n        can decide how to track the constants internally in the hook -- some\n        will be stateless, some statefull; the stateful ones may be updated via\n        side effects or via dispatches; some, like board, may be broken up\n        internally into pieces and highlights then combined together at the end.\n        Then we can define the functions, keeping any helpers hidden away in the\n        hook, invisible to the main file. How to do all this was the main\n        content of this post.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Testing</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        One of the main advantages of using a custom hook is that we can easily\n        test it without getting mixed up with the View component, and isolate\n        bugs before they get passed into the View.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As said in the previous section, with a custom hook we can usually\n        define the return right away. It seems like this is the best point to\n        sit down and write some tests -- before we write anything significant in\n        the custom hook file. We won't go into many details here, but there are\n        libraries to help with testing hooks.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'import { renderHook, act } from \"@testing-library/react-hooks\";\\n'}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Briefly: Here we can setup as many tests as we need which describe how\n        the constants and functions that our custom hook returns should work. We\n        call the hook using <code>renderHook</code>, test the initial return\n        values using <code>result.current</code>, do some actions (that is, use\n        the functions it returns) via <code>act</code>, and then test the new\n        return values.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'it(\"useGame initial states valid\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  const { result } = renderHook(() => useGame(0));\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {'  expect(states.gameStatus).toBe(\"ongoing\");\\n'}\n          {\"  expect(states.toPlayNext).toBe(0);\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(states.resetGame).toBeFunction;\\n\"}\n          {\"  // etc.\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'it(\"useGame detects horizontal win\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  const { result } = renderHook(() => useGame(0));\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {\"  // - - 1 1 1 - -\\n\"}\n          {\"  // - - 0 0 0 0 -    <- bottom row\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {\"  for (let i = 4; i < 11; i++) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    act(() =>\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"      result.current.placePiece(Math.floor(i / 2), result.current.toPlayNext)\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"    );\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {\n            \"  validStates(result.current); // helper function defined elsewhere\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"  expect(result.current.gameStatus).toBe(0);\\n\"}\n          {\"  \\n\"}\n          {\"  for (let col = 2; col < 6; i++) {\\n\"}\n          {\"    expect(result.current.board[0][col].isHighlight).toBe(true);\\n\"}\n          {\"  }\\n\"}\n          {\"  // etc.\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        (Do note that there are many alternative ways to test custom hooks,\n        including other libraries (I think), or creating a very basic View\n        purely for testing the hook.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It's good to do this before writing any substantial code in our hook to\n        ensure we have a clear vision of what we're about to create. We can then\n        create the core code without constantly worrying about what we've missed\n        or forgotten in the later stages -- the tests can tell us at any point\n        since they will fail.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Plus, if we had a stateful value, say, and realized it would be better\n        stateless (or vice-versa), we can make those changes internally, without\n        affecting the View, and then confirm our updates worked by running the\n        tests. The tests typically won't need any updates, as most changes will\n        be internal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We already covered one example of this earlier: adding in the ability to\n        forfeit the game. One way to handle this was changing the game status\n        from stateless to stateful (though there are other solutions too). We'd\n        need to do some refactoring inside our custom hook. But the point is, to\n        an external component or person using the game status that the hook\n        returns, it should still behave the same way. The same tests should\n        still apply and pass. The components may need to add in some new code to\n        deal with the new possible value of game status, but their old code\n        should still otherwise work. We'll need to add new tests, to test\n        forfeit scenarios and check (among other things) that the game status is\n        correct in these situations, but the old tests usually shouldn't break.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Similarly, if we had pieces and highlights combined into one value from\n        the start, and only later on decided we wanted to split them apart and\n        combine them with a calculation at the end, the same reasoning applies:\n        make the changes inside the custom hook, and use the same tests.\n        Ultimately a board constant still gets returned by the hook, so the\n        tests should still work perfectly fine. And in this case, we likely\n        wouldn't need to add any new tests either.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Summary</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        The point of this post wasn't simply to give out some tips and advice on\n        state management in React -- if I wanted to just do that, this article\n        could have been significantly shorter (and potentially clearer). The\n        point was to walk through (more or less) the process that I went through\n        to come to these conclusions. Having said that, it is easy to give a\n        quick summary, though it will lack in context.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          If you have some kind of object, concept, or general entity which a\n          user can interact with, you'll probably need to use state to\n          accomplish this. And encapsulating it all in a custom hook is likely\n          best.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          That doesn't mean you need to make all your constants stateful. If a\n          constant can be calculated from other constants, then leaving it\n          stateless is likely best.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If a constant can be stateless but, for some reason (efficiency\n          usually), that doesn't work well, then make it stateful and consider\n          using side effects to update it.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          When working with multiple stateful constants, be careful about using\n          a chain of dispatcher/setter calls, as you won't have access to the\n          updated values of those constants later on in the chain.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If a stateful constant is complex (an array or an object) consider\n          using a dispatcher instead of a setter.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Just because a View prefers a certain type of data for ease of use,\n          doesn't mean you need to work with the data in that form inside your\n          hook. You can unwrap it, maintain it separately, and then wrap it back\n          together right before passing it out of the hook.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Write tests for your hook (and for everything else) to make refactors\n          less likely to break things, and do this before writing your code.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>My Project</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Since writing the initial draft of this post, I've made extensive\n        progress on my own (as of now incomplete) Connect 4 game, and it looks\n        different from what I describe in this article. Of course, all the\n        principles we discussed still apply.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In particular, I did add the forfeit functionality in. I now have a\n        (stateless) <code>winner</code> value (which is null or the index of the\n        winner), which calculates itself based on a (also new){\" \"}\n        <code>forfeiter</code> value (null or index of forfeiter) and on the{\" \"}\n        <code>pieces</code> value. I have not, at this point, added an undo\n        feature. (Previously, the game status indicated the winner if the game\n        was won. But that didn't work cleanly once a game status of forfeit was\n        possible.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If you're curious, the code (including the full commit history) is on my\n        GitHub{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://github.com/kr-matthews/connect-4\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          here\n        </a>\n        .\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Update</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        My Connect 4 game is nearly done now, a few weeks after writing this\n        article. I learnt a lot more about React (and JavaScript) since then,\n        and a few of those things I learnt were related to state management, so\n        I figured I'd include them here in a brief update.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If you find yourself doing two or more things together repeatedly, it's\n        natural to consider wrapping them up together in a helper function and\n        just calling that repeatedly instead. However, if you <em>always</em> do\n        those things together and never individually, then you could consider\n        instead making one a side-effect.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For example, if you frequently use <code>setWinner(true)</code> when the\n        user wins, and then you always play some sound to let them know, then\n        it's probably best to just use a side-effect which runs whenever{\" \"}\n        <code>winner</code> updates and plays the sound if it's true. This may\n        be better than a helper function which sets the winner and plays the\n        sound, as this way you can easily out-source the sound effect into its\n        own hook, say. Then in another context where you're using the game hook\n        you've created but you don't want sound effects, you can just not call\n        the sound effect hook. There's no need to edit any helper functions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When I tried to do something along these lines, I ran into a problem. I\n        had added an option to mute all sounds, via <code>soundIsOn</code>. So\n        my side effect (using a <code>useEffect</code>) must check whether that\n        value is true and whether the user has won. So now both of these values\n        must be in the dependency array, and the side effect will run whenever\n        the user turns sound on. The specific problem arises when the user\n        previously won the game (so <code>winner</code> is <code>true</code>)\n        with sound off, and then they turn the sound on. The side effect is\n        triggered and both values are true so the sound plays. But it should\n        only play <em>when</em> the user wins (if sound is on).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The workaround here is to essentially set a flag that a sound may need\n        to be played. This flag is set in the original side effect above, which\n        no longer directly plays the sound and no longer depends on{\" \"}\n        <code>soundIsOn</code>. A separate side effect runs when that flag\n        changes and, unless sound is muted, plays the sound, and then that same\n        effect turns the flag off, regardless of whether sound is muted.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        That was a pretty quick explanation.

This is a brief article about how I improved my\n        workflow to reduce friction and omissions. There are certainly other\n        ways to achieve what I did, and many of those ways are probably better.\n        But what I did is relatively simple and easy to set up and get started,\n        without needing to install or learn anything significantly new. I'll\n        walk through the steps I went through to end up where I am today -- and\n        by the time you read this, I may have added further improvements and\n        extensions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Note: I use Bash, but the same ideas and steps should apply to Zsh or\n        any other shell, as far as I'm aware.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Note: The examples code blocks throughout aren't literal copy-pastes of\n        my own custom commands; they're essentially the same though, usually\n        just with the path and/or name changed.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Simplifying a Repetitive Command</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        My projects are a few levels down in my directories, and so every time I\n        open a terminal (which defaults to my home directory) to work on a\n        project, I need to <code>cd</code> to the directory of that project via\n        something along the lines of{\" \"}\n        <code>cd Documents/Projects/Current/MyProject/SubFolder</code>. Yes, I\n        can tab to auto-complete directories, but that's still annoying. In my\n        home directory there's also the Downloads folder, and I frequently tab\n        too early and Documents doesn't get auto-completed.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Ultimately, this isn't a problem -- it's just a minor annoyance.\n        However, if there's a simple way to reduce friction without introducing\n        any new problems, it's usually worth it. I figured that there must be a\n        way to create a shortcut or alias or text-expander or something along\n        those lines to eliminate this friction. A quick search brought me to\n        this{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://medium.com/devnetwork/how-to-create-your-own-custom-terminal-commands-c5008782a78e\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          article\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        which goes through how to set up custom commands to use in your\n        terminal. I took it a few steps further, so I won't reference it\n        directly, but that article is what got me set up initially. In fact, it\n        goes into more detail on how some things work than I will here, so it\n        may be worth reading.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Start by creating a file where you'll write your custom commands.\n        There's probably a 'best' place to store this file, but I'm not too\n        familiar with these kinds of conventions. You might also want to set it\n        up as a hidden file, meaning the name starts with a period and it won't\n        show up by default when viewing directories. Call it{\" \"}\n        <code>.customcommands.sh</code> or something. At the top put the line{\" \"}\n        <code>#!/bin/bash</code>. Below that, create a function. For instance:\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"#!/bin/bash\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"function cdproj() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  cd ~/Documents/Projects/Current/MyProject/SubFolder\\n\"}\n          {\"}\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        With just this file created, your new custom commands won't quite work.\n        They need to be loaded when you open a new terminal. Open{\" \"}\n        <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or the equivalent if you don't use Bash) and add\n        a new line with <code>source ~/path/to/file/.customcommands.sh</code>{\" \"}\n        (but modify the file path depending on where you saved it). Now, when\n        opening a new terminal, you only need to type out <code>cdproj</code> ,\n        instead of <code>cd</code> followed by the full path. And tab to\n        auto-complete still works, so you probably only need to type the first\n        three characters. If you have multiple projects, then create multiple\n        functions in the file and name them whatever you want -- but remember\n        that the point is to make them quick and easy to use.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Aggregating a Common Chain of Commands</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        After setting this up and using it for a while, I realized that after\n        navigating to my current project's directory, the next thing I usually\n        do is review what I was previously working on, and confirm what I need\n        to work on next. There are many ways to do this, depending on your\n        setup. If you use a nice IDE, such as Android Studio say, it may be able\n        to automatically list out your TODOs right in the interface (and you may\n        be able to customize how it finds them). If you use GitHub or GitLab,\n        you may just review the issues listed there (possibly filtering them\n        down based on some criteria). If you're working as part of a team, there\n        may already be some other system setup for you. In any case, if you have\n        a good workflow set up which works well, then stick with it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For me, working on a relatively small personal project, leavings\n        comments tagged with \"TODO\" in the code is quite simple and effective.\n        To check what I need to be working on after navigating to the project\n        directory, I use <code>git grep TODO</code>. So I created a new custom\n        command to automatically show me the project TODOs this way and wrapped\n        it together with the previous navigation function. And to remind myself\n        of my recent work, I can just review the log and status of the project.\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function cdproj() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  cd ~/Documents/Projects/Current/MyProject/SubFolder\\n\"}\n          {\"  git log\\n\"}\n          {\"  clear\\n\"}\n          {\"  git status\\n\"}\n          {\"  echo\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"TODOs:\"\\n'}\n          {\"  git grep TODO\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        Note that <code>git log</code> waits for you to dismiss it before the\n        next commands will execute, starting with <code>clear</code> -- assuming\n        the log didn't fit on the screen. If the log is short, this won't happen\n        and it will immediately be cleared so this won't work well. Also, if you\n        have a lot of TODOs (more than fit on the screen below the status), then\n        this probably isn't a good idea. So overall, still lots of room for\n        improvement here -- but it's been working well enough for me so far.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Aggregating Forgotten Commands</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        This was great for sitting down and quickly getting to work with no\n        unnecessary friction. However, I realized that something similar could\n        help when I'm done working. It's not so much that the commands are\n        tedious or repetitive when committing, pushing, and/or deploying work --\n        rather, I would often forget to do certain things. For instance, I\n        frequently deal with a TODO item, then commit and push the changes, only\n        to sit down to work the next time and realize the TODO comment is still\n        there and was part of the previous commit. (Yes, you can ammend commits,\n        but this is a bad idea if you've already pushed to another repository.)\n        This isn't a big deal, but it's potentially confusing to look back at\n        previous commits and see TODOs which are already done, especially if\n        they're brief and aren't clearly explained. Similarly, I would forget to\n        remove temporary print/debug lines.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        That's easy enough to prevent. Create a new custom command which prompts\n        you to check these:\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function precommit() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  git status\\n\"}\n          {\"  echo\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"Temporary lines:\"\\n'}\n          {\"  git grep TEMP\\n\"}\n          {\"  echo\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"TODOs:\"\\n'}\n          {\"  git grep TODO\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        As long as you remember to run <code>precommit</code> before doing a\n        commit, this works quite well. Yes, you still have to remember to do\n        something -- but it's just one thing to remember, instead of multiple\n        things. (If you really wanted, there's probably some way to redefine{\" \"}\n        <code>git commit</code> to do these checks for you and then ask for\n        permission before proceeding with the commit -- but I didn't look into\n        that.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A more significant issue which I was forgetting to deal with was tests\n        -- in particular, failing tests. I don't write as many tests as I should\n        for my personal projects. I often go a long time without thinking about\n        them, only to run them and realize that a few are failing -- and have\n        been failing for several commits now! Usually this ends up being because\n        I changed the way the code should behave and the failing test is simply\n        out-of-date, but in any case, your tests should probably all be passing\n        before you commit unless you've assessed them and decided to fix them at\n        a later point. So, throw those into the <code>precommit</code> routine:\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function precommit() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  npm test\\n\"}\n          {\"  git status\\n\"}\n          {\"  echo\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"Temporary lines:\"\\n'}\n          {\"  git grep TEMP\\n\"}\n          {\"  echo\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"TODOs:\"\\n'}\n          {\"  git grep TODO\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        Note that like <code>git log</code> earlier, the <code>npm test</code>{\" \"}\n        waits for you to dismiss it, at which point the rest of the commands\n        will run (starting with <code>git status</code>). This may work\n        differently if you do tests differently.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Meta Custom Commands</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        I introduced a few other miscellaneous commands for myself, in addition\n        to the above, and this eventually revealed two problems. First, I would\n        always forget where my custom commands file was stored, and exactly what\n        the name was -- which was a problem when trying to add or modify\n        commands. So I added a command to open the file (from anywhere):\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function editcustomcommands() {\\n\"}\n          {\"  vim ~/path/to/file/.customcommands.sh\\n\"}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        Second, I would sometimes forget the name of a command, especially if I\n        don't use it very often. Opening the file and searching for it works,\n        but isn't very efficient. So I added a command to simply print the names\n        of all my custom commands, by category:\n      </p>\n\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"function viewcustomcommands() {\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"Navigation: cdproj, cdarch, cdweb\"\\n'}\n          {\n            '  echo \"Projects:   cdproj, prework, precommit, fullreview, predeploy\"\\n'\n          }\n          {\"  // and more which I've omitted\\n\"}\n          {'  echo \"Meta:       viewcustomcommands, editcustomcommands\"\\n'}\n          {\"}\\n\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <p>\n        Again, with all of the above, auto-complete works so you only need to\n        type out the first few characters. Any names that make sense to you and\n        are quick to use are good names.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        It's relatively simple and easy to get some basic custom commands setup.\n        Once setup, they can improve your workflow by removing friction and\n        doing steps which you would otherwise have forgotten to do. If you have\n        a nice IDE, track issues on GitHub or GitLab, or work as part of a\n        larger team with a more formal workflow setup, then some of the\n        particular examples above may not be as useful -- but there's likely\n        still some friction which you could remove with this type of thinking.\n        I've barely scratched the surface here, so I'm sure there are lots of\n        other useful things you could do with just a little bit more research\n        yourself.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n","import \"./../../code.css\";\n\nexport default function Content() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Introduction</h2>\n      <p>\n        Plenty of articles and tutorials go on about how testing is good and\n        important and you should be in the habit of doing it. But it's easy,\n        especially in personal projects, to not bother with it. The best way to\n        encourage yourself to do something you want to do but aren't doing is,\n        in my experience, to remove all the friction. In this case, not knowing\n        or understanding how to test properly can be the main source of\n        friction.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In my own projects, when I tried to test my code, there were many things\n        I didn't understand. And when I tried looking them up, guides were\n        incomplete or didn't address my particular issue/concern (though maybe I\n        just didn't know the right search terms). In what follows, I've tried to\n        lay out everything that I needed to understand in order to\n        (more-or-less) properly incorporate tests for React hooks into my\n        personal projects. This includes the basics as well as some of the less\n        intuitive aspects. And I've done it through the lense of test-driven\n        development.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The primary purpose here is to confirm/solidify my own understanding,\n        and to have a good reference if I ever forget anything -- since, as I\n        mentioned, I struggled to find helpful resources for many specific\n        problems. But if someone else gets use out of it then that's great too.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>\n      <p>\n        Test-driven development is, as far as I understand it, the process of\n        figuring out what you want to build and how it should behave, codifying\n        that into tests, and only then writing the actual code via iteration\n        until all the tests pass.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are several advantages to this over first coding and then writing\n        tests (or over not writing tests at all!). First, it helps you get a\n        clear picture of what you're trying to achieve -- which can be\n        especially helpful when collaborating with other people. If you can't\n        describe how it will technically behave then you probably need to work\n        on resolving that before you start coding it. Second, you won't be\n        biased by the way you implemented the code and the edge cases you had to\n        explicitly deal with in the process; it's as if you're testing someone\n        else's code -- future you.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Since we're focusing on custom hooks in React, let's consider the\n        example of a tic-tac-toe game -- just for the purposes of having\n        something concrete to refer to. The game itself can be a custom hook: it\n        has some state, and you can perform actions on it. You might be tempted\n        to nail down exactly what context the game will be used in -- is it for\n        2 users, or is the (single) user playing against a computer player; in\n        the former case, are they playing on the same screen or playing\n        remotely; and so on -- but that's not really the concern of the game\n        hook. The game hook should ideally be reusable in any of these\n        situations (and more) with ease.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The three main things to consider for a hook are, in my experience: what\n        parameters it needs; what data (constants) it will return to be\n        observed; and what actions (functions) it will provide to manipulate it.\n        With these things clearly defined -- and a basic understanding of how\n        tests work -- it will be relatively simple to start writing some tests\n        which call the hook (with the parameters), do some actions with the hook\n        (via the returned functions), and check that the data (returned\n        constants) have the values that you would expect after those actions.\n        (There can be more to it than that, but we'll get to it later.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What does the game need to know? Well in our particular case, any game\n        of tic-tac-toe has two players, say 0 and 1. We could assume that player\n        0 goes first every time and the code which is using the game hook needs\n        to work around that assumption, but it seems nicer to deal with that in\n        the hook and provide more flexibility to the code using the hook. So the\n        game needs to know which player is going first -- call that{\" \"}\n        <code>firstToPlay</code>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I can't think of anything else at the moment. If there's something we\n        missed, we can add it in later. You might think that the player names\n        (and maybe the pieces (Xs and Os) or player colours) would be important\n        -- but that's all cosmetic and should be taken care of by the UI of\n        whatever code is using the game hook. We're only concerned with the\n        functionality of the game in the hook itself.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What about data to return? We certainly need to know the state of the\n        board -- who has played in what positions, and which positions are\n        empty. Call that <code>board</code>. There's a decision to be made here:\n        should this be returned as a 1-dimensional array, or a 2-dimensional\n        array? Or something else? There are two aspects to consider. First, what\n        would be easiest to work with for the code which will be using this game\n        hook? In our case, it's probably displaying the board, and maybe also\n        analyzing the board. A 2-dimensional array is probably best. In general,\n        if there's a clear answer here, then it's probably best to go with that.\n        If not, consider what is easiest to work with inside the game hook\n        itself. If the answer to these two questions is different, you can just\n        use the format which is easiest to implement inside the hook, and then\n        transform it into the easier format to work with outside the hook before\n        returning it. Then only reason this is worth thinking about is because\n        it will be relevant for writing tests -- you'll need to know the format\n        of the data.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Still on the returned data, we also need to know whos turn it is to play\n        next -- call that <code>nextToPlay</code>. Technically, this can be\n        calculated from the board together with who went first, so the hook\n        doesn't <em>need</em> to explicitly return it. But the point of creating\n        a custom hook is to make it easy and simple for other code to use it. So\n        it makes sense to return this. Likewise, we can return the result or\n        status of the current game -- ongoing vs draw vs player 1 won vs player\n        2 won. Call this <code>status</code>. You could instead split this into\n        status -- ongoing vs over -- and result -- draw vs player 1 won vs\n        player 2 won -- if you wanted.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        That seems like all the data we would need. As far as actions go, we\n        need a way for the next player to select a position to play in. This is\n        of course a function, say <code>play</code>, with parameters to specify\n        the row and column. Calling it will make the game hook place the piece\n        of player <code>nextToPlay</code> in that position (and of course will\n        update the other values, including <code>nextToPlay</code> and{\" \"}\n        <code>status</code>, as necessary). Finally, we probably want a function\n        to reset the game, say <code>reset</code>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This isn't the only way to do things, nor is it necessarily the best.\n        But it seems pretty reasonable to me.\n      </p>\n      <h2>The Basics of Testing Hooks</h2>\n      <p>\n        Now we're in a position to think about writing the actual tests. Suppose\n        the custom hook will be in the file <code>useGame.js</code>. Quickly set\n        up an exportable <code>useGame</code> hook (function) which takes no\n        parameters and returns an empty object. Then create{\" \"}\n        <code>useGame.test.js</code> and import the <code>useGame</code> hook.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The most basic thing to test might be that the hook starts off as\n        expected when it's initially called, before any actions are taken. In\n        this case, that would mean checking that it returns the constants and\n        functions which we mentioned above: <code>board</code>,{\" \"}\n        <code>nextToPlay</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>play</code>, and{\" \"}\n        <code>reset</code>. As with almost any type of test, we can do this with{\" \"}\n        <code>test</code> and <code>expect</code> in the test file as follows:\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'test(\"initial state\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"board\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"nextToPlay\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"status\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"play\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"reset\");\\n'}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Note that the test starts with a description. I believe that you can\n        also check that each of these properties has the correct type (for\n        example, check that the last two are functions) with additional expect\n        statements.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If you try running this (in the terminal via <code>npm test</code>), it\n        won't work unless you've defined <code>game</code>. If you try defining\n        it via <code>const game = useGame()</code>, either before the test or at\n        the start of the test, React will complain that you can't call a hook\n        outside of a component. This suggests that creating a dummy component\n        purely for the purposes of testing the hook might be the way to go. You\n        can certainly do that, and it might be best in some situations. But it\n        does involve extra work, and if you make mistakes in that dummy\n        component then the tests will fail even if the hook is working properly,\n        which can be annoying to figure out. Instead, we can use a testing\n        library to \"render\" the hook without a component.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'import { renderHook } from \"@testing-library/react-hooks\";'}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        At the start of the test, we can use this to call the hook. However,\n        this won't just return the return value of the hook like an ordinary\n        call -- it will return an object of which the hook's return value is\n        just one property (called <code>result</code>).\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'test(\"initial state\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  const game = renderHook(() => useGame()).result;\\n\"}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"board\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"nextToPlay\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"status\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"play\");\\n'}\n          {'  expect(game).toHaveProperty(\"reset\");\\n'}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This should work now, in the sense that the test will run (although\n        disclaimer: I haven't directly run any of the code from this post -- I'm\n        not being paid enough to do that). It will of course fail, since our\n        current implementation of the hook simply returns an empty object which\n        doesn't (yet) have these properties.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are a couple of things worth mentioning at this point. First, if\n        we have multiple tests (which we will), then it can be useful to group\n        them together into sets of tests. This can be accomplished via{\" \"}\n        <code>describe</code>, and it can help to more quickly identify at a\n        glance what parts of the hook aren't working when tests start failing.\n        (We won't use them much in this post though, for simplicity of\n        examples.)\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'describe(\"a set of tests\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  test(\"first test in the set\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"    const game = [...];\\n\"}\n          {\"    expect(game)[...]);\\n\"}\n          {\"  });\\n\"}\n          {'  test(\"second test in the set\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"    const game = [...];\\n\"}\n          {\"    expect(game)[...]);\\n\"}\n          {\"  });\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'describe(\"another set of tests\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  test(\"first test in the (second) set\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"    const game = [...];\\n\"}\n          {\"    expect(game)[...]);\\n\"}\n          {\"  });\\n\"}\n          {'  test(\"second test in the (second) set\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"    const game = [...];\\n\"}\n          {\"    expect(game)[...]);\\n\"}\n          {\"  });\\n\"}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        You can even have nested <code>describe</code>s.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Second, there is some redundancy here, as we're calling the hook at the\n        start of every test. If the hook gets an update later -- maybe it will\n        require an extra or a changed parameter -- then it will need to be\n        updated at the start of every single test. A better approach is to use{\" \"}\n        <code>beforeEach</code>.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"let game;\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  game = renderHook(() => useGame()).result;\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'describe(\"a set of tests\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  test(\"first test in the set\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"    expect(game)[...]);\\n\"}\n          {\"  });\\n\"}\n          {\"  [...]\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"[...]\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Now we should probably add the necessary parameters when we render the\n        hook, and while we're at it let's improve the initial state tests to\n        check that the data is correct.

Tic-tac-toe\n        is relatively simple, basically all you can do is play pieces and reset\n        the board. So let's try placing a piece.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// imports, beforeEach, etc. go here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"making a move\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  game.play(1, 1); // playing in the center\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.board[1][1]).toBe(firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.nextToPlay).toBe(1 - firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {'  expect(game.status).toHaveProperty(\"ongoing\");\\n'}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        I've made the assumption that the board will be a 2-dimensional array,\n        with null if nobody has played there, and the index of the player who\n        has played there otherwise. This isn't the only way to do it, as\n        discussed above. Given this, it would make sense to add more{\" \"}\n        <code>expect</code> statements to check that the other positions are\n        null -- both here and in the initial state test. As mentioned above,\n        I'll omit all that for simplicity.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Unfortunately, this won't pass, and not just because we haven't\n        implemented the hook yet. Even if the hook were functioning properly,\n        this test would fail, and there would be a warning. Basically, anything\n        that updates the state of the hook needs to be wrapped in{\" \"}\n        <code>act</code>, otherwise <code>renderHook</code> won't know to\n        trigger a re-render. Add that to the import along with{\" \"}\n        <code>renderHook</code> and wrap it around the action.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'import { renderHook, act } from \"@testing-library/react-hooks\";\\n'}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"// beforeEach, etc. here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"making a move\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  act(() => game.play(1, 1)); // playing in the center\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.board[1][1]).toBe(firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.nextToPlay).toBe(1 - firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {'  expect(game.status).toHaveProperty(\"ongoing\");\\n'}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        But this actually <em>still</em> wouldn't pass even if the hook were\n        functioning properly. This is because when you use <code>act</code> and\n        change the state inside the hook, it re-redners itself and returns a{\" \"}\n        <em>new</em> <code>result</code> property, while the above is still\n        using the <em>original</em> rendering's <code>result</code> property.\n        The fix here is to define <code>game</code> to be the whole object\n        returned by <code>renderHook</code> (instead of extracting the result\n        property immediately) and use <code>game.result</code> everywhere that\n        we've been using <code>game</code>. It's a bit annoying but it fixes\n        everything.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// imports, etc. here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\n            '  game = renderHook(() => useGame(firstToPlay)); // no \".result\" here\\n'\n          }\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"[...]\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"making a move\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  // using \".result\" everywhere\\n'}\n          {\"  act(() => game.result.play(1, 1)); // playing in the center\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.result.board[1][1]).toBe(firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(game.result.nextToPlay).toBe(1 - firstToPlay);\\n\"}\n          {'  expect(game.result.status).toHaveProperty(\"ongoing\");\\n'}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        After all that, this should finally pass (given a properly implemented{\" \"}\n        <code>useGame</code> hook).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I won't go through the details here, but to finish off the test creation\n        part of test-driven development we would need to write several more\n        tests, probably grouped via <code>describe</code>s, to account for all\n        possible scenarios that we can think of. This may be a lot of tests,\n        even for a relatively small/simple hook.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        With the hook parameters and return values specified, and a complete set\n        of tests written out, the final step of test-driven development is to\n        start writing the actual code. Pick the simplest (first) test which is\n        failing and work until it passes. Repeat until all tests pass. Add more\n        tests throughout if you realize you missed an edge case or anything like\n        that.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Testing Hook Effects</h2>\n      <p>\n        I said earlier that hooks essentially return data to observe and actions\n        to be done, but also hinted that there can be more to it than that. In\n        particular, you might have an effect happening via{\" \"}\n        <code>useEffect</code>. The tic-tac-toe game we described doesn't have\n        any effects. But we might have another custom hook which is tracking how\n        many wins each player has (and how many draws there have been). It can\n        take as parameter the status of the game, and returns three numbers\n        representing the win/draw counts. (And also a reset function might be\n        good.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This second hook doesn't return any actions to take (besides possibly{\" \"}\n        <code>reset</code>). It just observes the status supplied by the first\n        (game) hook and uses side effects to update the win/draw counts:\n        whenever the status changes -- that is to say, the dependency array\n        consists of <code>status</code> -- the effect checks what the value is\n        and increments the appropriate counter -- managed as internal state via{\" \"}\n        <code>useState</code> or <code>useReducer</code> -- by one.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A single, basic test for this would be to change the status from\n        'ongoing' to 'player 1 won', or to 'draw'. Another would be to change it\n        back to 'ongoing' and ensure nothing happens. We might try to write the\n        first test as follows.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// imports here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'let status = null; // represents \"ongoing\"\\n'}\n          {\"let scores;\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  scores = renderHook(() => useScores(status));\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"player 1 wins first game\", () => {\\n'}\n          {'  status = 1; // represents \"player 1 won\"\\n'}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.wins[0]).toBe(0); // player 0 has 0 wins\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.wins[1]).toBe(1); // player 1 has 1 win\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.draws).toBe(0); // there are no draws\\n\"}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        But this test would fail, even with properly implemented game and score\n        hooks. This is because the hook won't have updated itself. It will only\n        do so (as far as I know) when you explicitly take an action (via{\" \"}\n        <code>act</code>) or explicitly ask it to re-render with updated\n        parameters (via <code>rerender</code>).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Indeed, along with the result, the rendered hook also returns a\n        re-render function. This function re-renders the hook with the new\n        parameters you pass it. To make use of this, we'll have to modifiy the\n        initial call to <code>renderHook</code> to make it more explicit.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// imports here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"let scores;\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  const scores = renderHook(\\n\"}\n          {\"    ({ status }) =>\\n\"}\n          {\"      useScores(status),\\n\"}\n          {\"    { initialProps: { status: null} }\\n\"}\n          {\"  );\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"player 1 wins first game\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  scores.rerender({ status: 1 });\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.wins[0]).toBe(0); // player 0 has 0 wins\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.wins[1]).toBe(1); // player 1 has 1 win\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(scores.result.draws).toBe(0); // there are no draws\\n\"}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        With these changes, the test should pass given proper hook\n        implementations.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (One miscellaneous additional inconvenience which doesn't come up here\n        but I have experienced is that if you use <code>act</code> but don't\n        actually change any internal state, the hook won't update. For example,\n        suppose the hook takes as parameters a <code>number</code> and its{\" \"}\n        <code>setNumber</code> -- so the number state is being managed outside\n        the hook. Then an action which ultimately calls <code>setNumber</code>,\n        but doesn't change any other state, won't trigger a re-render. You'd\n        need to manual use <code>rerender</code>, as above, with the new\n        parameter value of <code>number</code> passed in. There's probably a\n        proper way to deal with this situation, but I'm not familiar with it.)\n      </p>\n      <h2>Mocking Parameters</h2>\n      <p>\n        Sometimes your tests might start failing despite having a hook which is\n        working perfectly well. This could happen if your tests are using a\n        dependency (other code) which has a bug or some other reason for not\n        working. The classic example is having tests fail because the hook\n        couldn't get a network connection -- the hook itself is working fine, so\n        failing tests aren't helpful here. It's best to try and remove this\n        possibility by mocking any dependencies. In the network example here, we\n        would want to just provide the expected data rather than actually\n        fetching it from the network in our tests, if possible.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The tic-tac-toe game and scoring example that we've been working with\n        aren't a great example (maybe I should have planned ahead better). Let's\n        suppose instead that it was a card game (maybe{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          Hearts\n        </a>\n        ), and one of the parameters for the game was a deck of cards which is\n        implemented as another custom hook. So we're calling a custom hook{\" \"}\n        <code>useDeck</code> which returns some data and actions -- in this\n        case, the cards left in the deck, a draw function to draw a card, a\n        shuffle function, and maybe more (return cards to deck, cut the deck,\n        reset, etc.) -- and passing this as one of the parameters to our{\" \"}\n        <code>useGame</code> custom hook. The deck is a dependency for the game.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If we write some tests for this game, similar to what we did above,\n        there would be two ways that the game hook tests could fail: either\n        there's a mistake in our implementation of the game hook; or there's a\n        mistake in our implmentation of the deck hook. We only want the test for\n        the game hook to fail if we're in the former case. To achieve this, we\n        can mock the deck hook. In fact, as discussed earlier, you can't call a\n        hook directly in a test, so it's not possible to just call the deck hook\n        and pass it in as a parameter. You can try using <code>renderHook</code>{\" \"}\n        to get an instance of the deck hook, but things get a bit messy as the{\" \"}\n        <code>result</code> property is changed every re-render -- but in any\n        case, we just said we don't want to pass the real hook in as a\n        parameter, we want to mock it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When mocking something, you can't use any state -- for the same reason\n        you can't call a custom hook in a test file, you can't call any standard\n        hooks like <code>useState</code>. For a deck of cards, we can just\n        define an explicit array of cards and define the draw function to pop\n        from that, and the shuffle function could do nothing. This has the\n        additional benefit that we can decide which order the cards are drawn in\n        and can avoid randomness (which could lead to inconsistent pass/fail\n        results) in our tests.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"let cards;\\n\"}\n          {\"let draw = () => cards.pop();\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"// hearts hook won't use the other deck properties, so don't include\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"let mockDeck = { draw };\\n\"}\n          {\"let hearts;\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  cards = [...]; // explicitly specify the card stack\\n\"}\n          {\"  hearts = renderHook(() => useHearts(mockDeck, ...));\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"// tests here\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        As a side note, this seems a bit like cheating, because any direct\n        changes to variables should be lost on re-render, but arrays are\n        pointers to their contents and the contents of arrays don't get reset on\n        re-render. This has always confused me a bit -- and initially led to\n        many long-lasting misunderstandings while I was trying to learn React.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Alternatively, we could use jest mock functions to mock the deck.\n        Indeed, given the remark in the previous paragraph, this is probably the\n        'proper' way to deal with the situation. With this, instead of setting\n        up an array of cards and defining a draw function, we just define a mock\n        draw function which we can manipulate as needed to return whatever we\n        want.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"let draw = jest.fn();\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"// hearts hook won't use the other deck properties, so don't include\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"let mockDeck = { draw };\\n\"}\n          {\"let hearts;\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"beforeEach(() => {\\n\"}\n          {\"  hearts = renderHook(() => useHearts(mockDeck, ...));\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"// tests here\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Now, in our tests, whenever cards are expected to be drawn, we can tell\n        the mock draw function exactly what to do in advance. We can tell it to\n        return a particular value next time it is called, or to keep returning\n        the same value every time it is called (until we tell it to do\n        otherwise), or give it a temporary (simplified) implementation, and much\n        more -- see the{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          documentation\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        for a full list. In the game of hearts, if somebody was dealing one card\n        at a time (which maybe isn't how it would work in practice, but just to\n        keep things simple here) we could tell the draw function specifically\n        which card to return.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {\"// setup code from above here\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {'test(\"dealing a card to player 2\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\"  const sixOfSpades = ...; // whatever data structure you use\\n\"}\n          {\"  // tell draw function to return 6S next time it's called\\n\"}\n          {\"  draw.mockReturnValueOnce(sixOfSpades)\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"  // inside the hearts hook, the mock draw function will be called once\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"  hearts.result.dealOneToPlayer(2);\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"  // player 2's hand has the card\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(hearts.result.hands[2]).toContain(sixOfSpades);\\n\"}\n          {\"  // player 0's hand doesn't\\n\"}\n          {\"  expect(hearts.result.hands[0]).not.toContain(sixOfSpades);\\n\"}\n          {\"});\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Note that if you called <code>dealOneToPlayer</code> a second time in\n        the test above, the draw function would (I think) return null the second\n        time -- you'd need to mock the return value once again before the second\n        call. Or you could get more detailed and define an implementation -- but\n        then you're adding complexity and increasing the chances that a test\n        would fail due to a mistake in the mocked functions, rather than in the\n        hook you're actually trying to test. There are also plenty of other\n        things you can do with mock functions, such as checking how many times\n        they've been called. That's not directly related to what we're doing\n        here (as far as I know -- which isn't very far) so we won't get into it.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Mocking Imports</h2>\n      <p>\n        The other main way that unrelated code could cause your tests to fail\n        unnecessarily is if the hook being tested imports helper functions from\n        another file. For example, some calculation may be done after a player\n        makes a move in some type of game, and then assigned a score based on\n        that -- the calculation of that score, based on some parameters, might\n        be in a helper file.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'import { helperFunction } from \"./helperFile\";\\n'}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"function useGame(...) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  ...\\n\"}\n          {\"  score = helperFunction(...);\\n\"}\n          {\"  ...\\n\"}\n          {\"  return { ... }\\n\"}\n          {\"};\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This seems a bit tricky at first, because there's no place that the\n        helper function is explicity passed in that you can mock. It's not even\n        directly imported in the test file itself - only in the hook file! But\n        in fact it's not very difficult at all once you've been told what to do.\n        Think of the import line in the hook file as an assignment{\" \"}\n        <code>const helperFunction = helperFile.helperFunction</code> which is\n        implicitly happening. We can intercept that assignment, in the test\n        file, by mocking the entire helper file that's providing the helper\n        function.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'jest.mock(\"./helperFile\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\n            \"  // if needed, can import the actual file with all the original functions\\n\"\n          }\n          {\n            '  const actualFile = jest.requireActual(\"../playing-cards/cardHelpers.js\");\\n'\n          }\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"  // return what the helper file would return (the exported functions) -\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"  // but replacing any you want to mock\\n\"}\n          {\"  return {\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"    __esModule: true, // apparently this is required, not sure why\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"    ...actualFile, // original returns\\n\"}\n          {\"    helperFunction: jest.fn() // replace this one with a mock\\n\"}\n          {\"  };\\n\"}\n          {\"});\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"// imports, setup, beforeEach, tests, etc. here\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        From here, it's the same as with <code>draw</code> above -- just mock\n        return values or whatever you need to do, inside any tests.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>\n      <p>\n        In fact, the second situation above, where we mocked a dependency (\n        <code>helperFunction</code>) being imported, could instead be tranformed\n        into the first situation above, where we mocked a parameter (\n        <code>deck</code>). This can be done simply by making{\" \"}\n        <code>helperFunction</code> into an explicit parameter of the hook.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'import { helperFunction } from \"./helperFile\";\\n'}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"// providing a new param f at the end with default value the helper function\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"function useGame(..., f = helperFunction) {\\n\"}\n          {\"  ...\\n\"}\n          {\"  score = f(...); // call f here\\n\"}\n          {\"  ...\\n\"}\n          {\"  return { ... }\\n\"}\n          {\"};\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        Now the call to <code>f</code> in the hook is referring to the parameter\n        passed in, instead of directly to the value exported from the file. So\n        instead of mocking the imported file and slipping in the mock version of\n        the helper function, we can simplify to just mocking the single helper\n        function and passing that in as a parameter to the hook.\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code>\n          {'// jest.mock(\"./helperFile\", () => {\\n'}\n          {\n            \"//   // if needed, can import the actual file with all the original functions\\n\"\n          }\n          {\n            '//   const actualFile = jest.requireActual(\"../playing-cards/cardHelpers.js\");\\n'\n          }\n          {\"//\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"//  // return what the helper file would return (the exported functions) -\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"//  // but replacing any you want to mock\\n\"}\n          {\"//   return {\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"//     __esModule: true, // apparently this is required, not sure why\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"//     ...actualFile, // original returns\\n\"}\n          {\"//     helperFunction: jest.fn() // replace this one\\n\"}\n          {\"//   };\\n\"}\n          {\"// });\\n\"}\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\n            \"let helperFunction = jest.fn(); // replace the above with just this!\\n\"\n          }\n          {\"\\n\"}\n          {\"// imports, setup, beforeEach, tests, etc. here\"}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This is called dependency injection: dependencies are passed in\n        explicitly as parameters so that they can easily be swapped out (which\n        comes in handy for testing in particular).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Often, if you have some complex calculation or anything like that going\n        on somewhere inside your hook, you can wrap it up, do that calculation\n        outside of the hook, and pass it in as a parameter. This makes testing\n        easier, and likely also improves the separation of concern in your code\n        base.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n      <p>\n        It's easy to get discouraged from writing tests when new situations\n        arise and you aren't sure how to deal with them. Figuring out a proper\n        way to handle these unfamiliar situations (via searching online or\n        deducing it on your own) can be difficult, but typically once you have a\n        solution it's relative simple and routine. It's therefore worth putting\n        in that bit of effort once, and bookmarking or documenting what you\n        learn from it.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/alt-solved-cube-physical.9d49f7dd.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/react-logo.2fad5f46.png\";","//// article contents\n\nimport RubiksCubeBlindfolded from \"./articles/001-rubiks-cube-blindfolded/rubiks-cube-blindfolded.js\";\nimport ReactStateManagement from \"./articles/002-react-state-management/react-state-management.js\";\nimport TerminalCustomCommands from \"./articles/003-terminal-custom-commands/terminal-custom-commands.js\";\nimport TestingReactHooks from \"./articles/004-testing-react-hooks/testing-react-hooks.js\";\n\n//// article images\n\nimport RubiksCubeBlindfoldedImage from \"./articles/001-rubiks-cube-blindfolded/alt-solved-cube-physical.jpg\";\nimport ReactStateManagementImage from \"./articles/002-react-state-management/react-logo.png\";\nimport TerminalCustomCommandsImage from \"./articles/003-terminal-custom-commands/code-icon.png\";\n// currently using default image for TestingReactHooks\n\n//// list of articles\n\n// this will be sorted by publishDate, so can be in any order\nexport const articles = [\n  {\n    title:\n      \"Understanding how someone else might be able to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded\",\n    link: \"rubiks-cube-blindfolded\",\n    startDate: new Date(\"2021-07-31\"),\n    publishDate: new Date(\"2021-08-19\"),\n    // editDate: new Date(\"\"),\n    image: RubiksCubeBlindfoldedImage,\n    tags: [\"Rubik's Cubes\"],\n    preview:\n      \"This is the first in a series of articles about solving Rubik's Cubes blindfolded.
