        I'm Kevin Matthews, a mathematician by training and a self-taught programmer. Generally, I'm interested in most kinds of problem solving related to mathematics and programming. Among other things, I like systems design -- how software applications are structured, how cities function, how organizations setup their workflows, and such.

Most are simple games, but there are also some more useful things, such as an integration with the Strava API, a bike route map of Metro Vancouver, and a reusable footer component for use across my various projects. I also have ideas for other types of projects in the future.
