               explaining the core concepts behind blindfolded solving. Essentially, you memorize a sequence of letters where each letter is an instruction for what to do next, and you convert these letters to images/sentences/stories to remember them.

               which lists the images I use for this, and the move sequences (also known as algorithms in the community) which I use to solve each pair of pieces. (I also use the images for memory sports, including memorizing numbers and playing cards.)
            </p>
            <p>
              My system is relatively unique in the blindfolded solving community in that it is based on phonemes and pronunciation rather than letters and spelling. Memory sports athletes usually use phonemes, as far as I understand, though I came up with the idea independently. It took literally years of experimenting to get my system to where it is today.

              Graham pointed out a special case to me one day where he was able to reduce his algorithm count by one. I played around and realized that it could be generalized to apply to a large portion of scrambles, and together we nailed down what turned out to be a relatively simple method to incorporate it into every cube in an attempt.
