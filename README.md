# Personal Website

This is my personal website, which highlights some key information about myself and contains my projects and writings.

## View

On GitHub Pages at [https://kr-matthews.github.io/](https://kr-matthews.github.io/).

## Initial Version

This was my first project in React, and my second time doing web development (the first being a terrible website made with Racket and extremely basic HTML - no CSS), so the quality and organization was quite poor.
I was mainly trying to learn stuff and get more familiar with React.

## Refactor I

After deploying the first version of my website, I moved on to several additional projects (all listed on GitHub, and on this website itself) and improved my skills and techniques a lot.
I decided to come back and improve the code based on what I had learnt, since I could clearer see a lot of bugs and flaws.
It was still far from perfect of course.

## Refactor II

After the first refactor, I continued on to a few other React projects, and eventually got a new job where I was working with React on a daily basis.
Around the same time, I read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
Based on all this, I once again looked back at this project and identified a lot of major issues, so decided to do another refactor.

## Features

There isn't much end-user functionality to explore or use.
The main feature is the ability to navigate around to various pages.

The main pages are the projects page, which lists all of my coding projects (and a few other non-coding projects of note), and the blog page, which contains a few articles I've written (mostly for myself).

More features may be added later.
