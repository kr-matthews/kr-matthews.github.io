# Personal Website

This is a personal website I was working on, with the primary aim of becoming more familiar with websites, and in particular, React and CSS.

It was my first project in React (and first time using CSS), so the quality and organization may be poor. However, I have done several additional projects since then and have improved a lot.

### View

### Features

It contains a project gallery (portfolio) and a simple blog, among other things. More may be added later.
