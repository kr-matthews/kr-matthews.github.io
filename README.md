# Personal Website

This is a personal website I was working on, with the primary aim of becoming more familiar with websites, and in particular, React.js and CSS.

It was my first project in React.js (and first time using CSS), so the quality and organization may be poor. However, I have done several additional projects since then (all visible here on GitHub) and have improved a lot.

### Update

After learning a lot by doing several other React.js projects, I came back and cleaned this up. It's still far from perfect of course.

### View

On GitHub Pages at [https://kr-matthews.github.io/](https://kr-matthews.github.io/).

### Features

It started as a project gallery (portfolio) and a simple blog. Since then, I've added a page about Rubik's Cubes and a page about Vancouver. I may add more later.
